0,New Document Reveals Lynch Instructed Comey to Cover-up For Hillary,http://president45donaldtrump.com/1-9892-2/,"VIA| Ah, the infamous tarmac meeting.  You knowâ¦the one in which former Attorney General Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clintonâ¦in her airplaneâ¦at the Phoenix Airport?  The one after which many people suspected that a âdealâ had gone down to get Hillary off the hook? Wellâ¦according to a report in the NY Times, FBI Director James Comey may have been in the same corner as those of us who had concerns about Lynchâs objectivity and political bias towards Clinton. From NY Times: At the meeting, everyone agreed that Mr. Comey should not reveal details about the Clinton investigation. But Ms. Lynch told him to be even more circumspect: Do not even call it an investigation, she said, according to three people who attended the meeting. Call it a âmatter.â",1
1,Chris Christie: âWomenâs Viagra Pill Will Only Increase Lesbianismâ,no_url,"âThe New York Times relates that âRepresentative Cathy McMorris Rogers of Washington State, the top-ranking Republican woman in the House, was quoted by The Daily Beast last week as saying that Democrats were fabricating the âwar on womenâ to distract from real issues. Joan Walsh wrote on AlterNet: âRead and decide for yourself if this war on women is imaginary:âââDemocrats didnât make the GOP presidential field back âpersonhoodâ laws that would criminalize some forms of birth control. They didnât force the newly elected house GOP to make defunding Planned Parenthood their first legislative goal. And they didnât propose the Blunt Amendment that would have allowed employers to withhold health insurance coverage not only for contraception, but for any treatment they disapproved of.âFurthermore, it would seem that Cathy McMorris Rogers isnât the only Republican waging a crusade against her own sex. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, famous for his sharp tongue and conservative political views, seems to have sjoined McMorris Rogers in their partyâs obvious war on women in America.Christie recently addressed the rumors that pharmaceutical companies are extensively researching a Viagra pill for women. The New Jersey governor allegedly denied that such a pill would have numerous benefits for women in a televised interview and verbally attacked the host for asking him such âoffensive and idiotic questions.â When asked to comment on the incident by Newslo, Christie said: âOh no, I really feel like women could use a Viagra pill. Like we donât have enough dykes already.âAsked to elaborate on his offensive language, the anything-but-subtle Republican stated that âthe only thing such a pill would do for the women of the world is get them to change their sexual orientation.ââThe men of today already have enough trouble satisfying women as it is. Why do you think Viagra was invented in the first place? But no, letâs amplify womenâs sex drive even further, thatâll definitely help them feel more satisfied and relaxed. And who are they going to turn to quench that thirst? Other women. Men arenât machines, but neither are they. They just havenât realized it yet,â Christie concluded.",1
2,Roger Stone Blames Obama For The Possibility Of Trump Having Alzheimerâs Because âHis Attacks On The President Caused Severe Stressâ,no_url,"The whispers are growing louder that President Donald Trump may be suffering some sort of mental decline and cognitive impairment â and his longtime pal Roger Stone thinks itâs a conspiracy. MSNBCâs Joe Scarborough, who has known the president for years, has been suggesting on air that Trump is suffering from mental decline and possibly even dementia. Stone, who has known the president for decades and claims to remain in close contact, told InfoWars founder Alex Jones the concerns about Trumpâs mental state were part of a plot to remove him from the White House, reported Mediaite. âThey are going to claim that Donald Trump has Alzheimerâsâ¦and that is the source of his insanity,â Stone told Jones.âLook, Alex â Iâve known Donald Trump for many years now and during that time Iâve gotten very close with him,â Stone said. âJust like youâre able to tell when your mother or father or some other family member or friend you spend a lot of time with starts to change in any way, Iâm also able to tell you all of Donaldâs little habits, mannerisms, quirky gestures he makes when he speaks and even predict what heâs going to say and how heâs going to behave depending on his mood. As a matter of fact, Iâd even go so far as to say that the man is more like a brother to me than a friend. And like I said, when youâve spent that much time with someone and gotten to know virtually everything about them, itâs very easy to tell if and when they start behaving oddly. You know what I mean?âStone continued, âIâm telling you right here and now â itâs all one huge conspiracy to get people to believe Donald is unfit for duty and get him out of the White House. Itâs the only option they have left, since they couldnât beat him the normal way. Donald Trump does not have Alzheimerâs, dementia or whatever else theyâre saying heâs suffering from.â Jones asked, âBut look, I hear you, I get what youâre saying and Iâm on your side, but you have to admit â heâs not a young man anymore, heâs 70 years old and heâs continuously been exposed to huge amounts of stress on a daily level for decades. Are you saying thatâs not even a remote possibility?â Stone replied, âWell, thatâs the thing, Alex â Iâm not a doctor. Iâve spoken to him recently and he was his usual self, from what I could gather.ââThat being said, in my book, heâs the same, old Donald whom Iâve known for years and years. Of course, as I mentioned â Iâm not a doctor or a professional, so I donât have any medical argumentation to support my claims. But, I will say this: in the unlikely event Iâm wrong and he does have a mental impairment, itâs Barack Obamaâs fault. I mean, Barack Obama has attacked Donald Trump since the moment he realized that Donald was thinking about running for president â I think even before he initiated his campaign. His attacks on Donald Trump caused immense stress on a daily level because, thatâs the thing â Obama had no other arguments to dispute Donaldâs campaign other than to make jokes about how heâs a bad employer and how business is all heâs ever been good at. Sure, heâs not a politician, but heâs a self-made man. In my book, thatâs way better than being a so-called Democrat who cares more about illegal and Muslim immigrants than he does for his own people. So, I would certainly understand if Donald has Alzheimerâs because of Barack Obama,â Stone concluded.",1
3,TODAY: Trump Authorizes Congress To Pursue Criminal Charges Against Hillary,http://conservativearmy88.com/today-trump-authorizes-congress-pursue-criminal-charges-hillary/,"President Trump has approved Congress to seek after criminal allegations against Hillary Clinton, regardless of the possibility that that implies she winds up in jail.Director of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Jason Chaffetz, told individuals from the advisory group that a current meeting amongst him and the President uncovered a yearning by Trump to guarantee Hillary Clinton gets whatever equity she merits.Chaffetz told individuals:âPresident Trump went to Philadelphia when we were at our arranging and procedure session.I ran backstage with the President this is what he stated:âYou make an incredible showing with regards to. Tune in, I comprehend Iâm the president and you have an occupation. You do the oversight. Try not to back off. Follow all that you need to follow. You take a gander at all that you need to take a gander at.âIn the event that you sat there and heard what he said to me in regards to seeking after oversight and government, you would be propelled. Furthermore, for him to pass on a message of âdonât back off,â I believe was a decent message.âThe news that the President bolsterâs the criminal examination comes days after the Oversight Committee requested FBI Director, James Comey, to hand over the substance of Hillary Clintonâs email server.Trumpâs words will probably support their resolve in uncovering any criminal wrong doing by the previous Secretary of State in their proceeded with examination concerning Hillary Clintonâs utilization of a private email server.âThis was never a political focusing in the first place and in light of the fact that there was a political race doesnât mean it leaves,â Jason Chaffetz told journalists before in the month. âThere were a considerable measure of different characters that were included in this that we need to take a gander at.â",1
4,NPR: 25 Million Votes For Clinton âCompletely Fakeâ â She Lost Popular Vote,http://conservativearmy88.com/npr-25-million-votes-clinton-completely-fake-lost-popular-vote-2/,"A study published by NPR reveals that over 25 million Hillary Clinton votes were completely fraudulent, meaning that the Democratic candidate actually lost the popular vote by a huge margin.A study by the Pew Center claiming that over 800,000 non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton failed to take into account dead and fraudulent voters which totalled over 25 million âregistered votersâ.According to reports, illegal aliens combined with dead voters and âmultiple stateâ voters explains why Hillary appeared to have won the popular vote over Trump during this years presidential race.âA report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1.8 million dead people are currently registered to vote, and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate,â NPR reported in 2012, which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats.And many of the dead, registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave, most recently in Philadelphia, Penn. and Colorado.Itâs also worth noting that the U.S. population has increased since 2012, meaning that thereâs likely more dead and invalid voters than before.ââ¦The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state,â NPR added.Thatâs because when a new resident registers to vote in a state, officials usually never bother to tell his former state about the change in voter residency.Under the âcatch and releaseâ immigration program by the Obama administration, illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials, so it was theoretically possible for non-citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally, then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer-funded bus dropped them off.Clinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election, including dense urban areas in New York and California, yet she only won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump â and that Democrats would have depended more on illegal votes.A portion of the 24 million invalid voter registrations combined with a portion of the 1.8 million dead voters and the over 800,000 known illegal voters could explain the difference of 2.8 million votes, and itâs worth noting that the 800,000 figure could be a low, conservative estimate.That said, a popular vote victory is meaningless; if the president was elected by popular vote, then both Trump and Clinton would have campaigned in entirely different states because only densely population regions of the U.S. would decide who would become president.Without the electoral college, the United States of America would be reduced to the United States of New York and California, with 48 other vassal states.Yet notice how Clinton campaigned in other, less populated states. They knew the popular vote was meaningless ahead of the election.However, the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal, invalid and dead voters.",1
5,CONFIRMED: Mueller Team Can Be Disbarred For Clinton Conflicts In Trump Case,http://conservativearmy88.com/cconfirmed-mueller-team-can-disbarred-clinton-conflicts-trump-case/,"A top national attorney in consultation with U.S. attorneys confirmed to Big League Politics that special counsel Robert Mueller and members of his team can be formally disbarred for waging the âRussiaâ case against President Donald Trump. Mueller and his associates have glaring conflicts of interest in the case concerning Trump.Muellerâs team is tainted not only by partisan political donations and activities, but by direct relationships with former clients like Hillary Clinton, who is integrally involved in most of the possible evidence in this case. These conflicts clearly violate American Bar Association guidelines.Hillary Clinton colluded with the Russians in selling them our uranium. Clinton handpicked Mueller to give a sample of uranium to the Russians, and Mueller subsequently flew to Moscow, according to publicly available documents.Don Trump Jr.âs meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer, a showbiz manager and others â in which the adoption-related Magnitsky Act was discussed â is the only thing resembling evidence that the mainstream media has been able to find. But that meeting is tarred with Clinton connections. According to Wikileaks, a Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman said that âWith the help of the research team we killed a Bloomberg story trying to link HRCâs opposition to the Magnitsky bill to a $500,000 speech that [Bill Clinton] gave in Moscow.â Radio host Andrew Wilkow said that Clinton took $500,000 from Sberbank, a Russian bank represented by the Podesta Group that also happens to be a client of Natalia Veselnitskayaâs law firm (Veselnitskaya is the Russian lawyer who met with Don Jr.).Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and the DNC accuse the Russians of hacking their emails, despite evidence to the contrary, which provides further Clinton involvement in the case and further conflicts for Muellerâs Clinton-linked team.Muellerâs 13-member Dream Team is comprised of anti-Trump stalwarts including three Democratic Party donors, legal representatives for Hillary Clinton during her email scandal, and vociferous anti-Trump tweeter Preet Bharara, who was fired by Trump from his position as a U.S. Attorney within the Department of Justice. These conflicts of interests, especially pertaining to Clinton, make it necessary for some members of the team to recuse themselves. If they donât, they can be disbarred.The American Bar Associationâs Criminal Justice Standards for the Prosecution Function make clear that Muellerâs team is in violation of standards, according to the top national attorney. Here are the relevant sections (emphasis added):âA prosecutor should not use other improper considerations, such as partisan or political or personal considerations, in exercising prosecutorial discretion. A prosecutor should strive to eliminate implicit biases, and act to mitigate any improper bias or prejudice when credibly informed that it exists within the scope of the prosecutorâs authority.(b)  A prosecutorâs office should be proactive in efforts to detect, investigate, and eliminate improper biases, with particular attention to historically persistent biases like race, in all of its work.  A prosecutorâs office should regularly assess the potential for biased or unfairly disparate impacts of its policies on communities within the prosecutorâs jurisdiction, and eliminate those impacts that cannot be properly justified.ââStandard 3-1.7           Conflicts of Interest(a)  The prosecutor should know and abide by the ethical rules regarding conflicts of interest that apply in the jurisdiction, and be sensitive to facts that may raise conflict issues.  When a conflict requiring recusal exists and is non-waivable, or informed consent has not been obtained, the prosecutor should recuse from further participation in the matter. The office should not go forward until a non-conflicted prosecutor, or an adequate waiver, is in placeâ¦ââ(c)  The prosecutor should not participate in a matter in which the prosecutor previously participated, personally and substantially, as a non-prosecutor, unless the appropriate government office, and when necessary a former client, gives informed consent confirmed in writing.(d)  The prosecutor should not be involved in the prosecution of a former client. A prosecutor who has formerly represented a client should not use information obtained from that representation to the disadvantage of the former client.ââ(f)  The prosecutor should not permit the prosecutorâs professional judgment or obligations to be affected by the prosecutorâs personal, political, financial, professional, business, property, or other interests or relationships.  A prosecutor should not allow interests in personal advancement or aggrandizement to affect judgments regarding what is in the best interests of justice in any case.ââg)  The prosecutor should disclose to appropriate supervisory personnel any facts or interests that could reasonably be viewed as raising a potential conflict of interest.  If it is determined that the prosecutor should nevertheless continue to act in the matter, the prosecutor and supervisors should consider whether any disclosure to a court or defense counsel should be made, and make such disclosure if appropriate.ââ(j)  The prosecutor should promptly report to a supervisor all but the most obviously frivolous misconduct allegations made, publicly or privately, against the prosecutor.  If a supervisor or judge initially determines that an allegation is serious enough to warrant official investigation, reasonable measures, including possible recusal, should be instituted to ensure that the prosecution function is fairly and effectively carried out.  A mere allegation of misconduct is not a sufficient basis for prosecutorial recusal, and should not deter a prosecutor from attending to the prosecutorâs duties.âThe conflicts of interest are everywhere.Peter Strzok, who oversaw the Hillary Clinton email investigation for the FBI and interviewed Hillary Clinton, is on Muellerâs team.Clinton donor Jeannie Rhee, who represented the Clinton Foundation and also Hillary Clinton during the email investigation, is on Muellerâs team.Aaron Zebley, who repped Clinton aide and key email-scandal figure Justin Cooper, is on Muellerâs team.Andrew Weissmann defended the federal governmentâs surveillance rightsin a panel discussion at the George Soros-funded New America Foundation, is also an Obama donor.Preet Bharara, the man who prosecuted conservative writer Dinesh DâSouza and was a leading contender to be Hillary Clintonâs theoretical Attorney General, was fired by the Trump administration, presenting another conflict of interest that he seems to have no intention of hiding.How about Mueller himself?CIA and NSA whistleblower Dennis Montgomery identified former FBI director Mueller as having overseen a secret surveillance program that spied on Trumpâs phone calls for years. The alleged program, created during the Bush administration and run by Obama intelligence officials John Brennan and James Clapper, is detailed on 47 hard drives that Montgomery and his lawyer turned over to the FBI, which James Comey buried. Montgomery is suing Obama, Brennan, Clapper and others in a case before D.C. District Court Judge Richard Leon. This case is being watched closely by insiders on both sides of the Russia probe.Mueller also helped stonewall the Obama administrationâs âinvestigationâ of its own IRS targeting scandal.As Big League Politics reported, Mueller has formed a political team with his friend, fired FBI director James Comey, and the current FBI director Andrew McCabe to work together against President Donald Trump. But Mueller and Comey are not the ringleaders. Surprisingly, itâs McCabe.An inside source told Big League Politics that McCabe is ârunning the show,â and âheâs the key.ââMueller and McCabe are assembling a better political operation than Hillary had in the campaign. The trio of Mueller/McCabe and Comey are all creatures of the swamp,â the source explained. âAny Republican who thinks this isnât a political operation and isnât geared toward impacting 2018 and beyond is absolutely nuts.ââI think McCabe is the most politically savvy given how he navigated the controversy with his wifeâs campaign donations and the Clinton investigation,â the source continued.McCabe took over when Comey got fired and quickly set up the teamâs power play. McCabe said that Comey did not get fired from the FBI for performance issues. That sets up the premise for a potential obstruction of justice move by the McCabe-Mueller-Comey trio.",1

In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there.Fordâs south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.The Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Fordâs full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday.âOur investmentâ¦reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,â said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. âWorking with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.âThe move comes at a delicate time for Ford.The United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAM) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union.The union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker hasnât said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. Itâs also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs.âWeâre actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We havenât decided what will go there,â said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if heâs elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States.âHow does that help us?â Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. âMexico is becoming the new China.âSource:www.viralliberty.com",1

He caught heat from fellow actors when he called President Obamaâs agenda âanti-Christian.â Washington has been very vocal about his own religious beliefs, which obviously donât align with Obamaâs attempts to do away with traditional values.Washington was the son of a preacher and spent the majority of his time in the church, but transformed into a rebellious teenager. After what Washington calls a âpersonal face along with God,â he returned to the church in his twenties.âI had this particular tremendous physical and spiritual experience,â Washington describes.His devotion and willingness to speak his own mind is a shock to liberal Hollywood, but we applaud him for speaking the truth.Do you agree?Source:www.americannews.com",1
8,Trump Sends Feds In To Raid NYâs Islamberg After 2 DECADES â Uncover Americaâs WORST Nightmare,http://www.redrocktribune.com/feds-raid-nys-islamberg/,"NEW YORKâS ISLAMBERG HAS BEEN ON THE RADAR FOR TERRORISTIC ACTIVITY FOR DECADES BUT LAW OFFICIALS NEVER HAD A REASON FOR A SEARCH WARRANT.FINALLY, law enforcement was able to obtain a search warrant for the Islamberg compound. Though the Muslim compound has been suspected for terrorism because of their guarded entrance and the sound of explosions and gunfire for the last couple of decades law enforcement never found a reason to obtain a search warrant until now.From Freedom Daily:But with a recent arrest of Islamberg resident Ramadan Abdullah who was recently caught trying to steal several cases of ammunition from a local mountain store in the area, authorities finally had their chance to obtain a search warrant for the compound, and what they discovered was nothing short of chilling.Shortly after arresting Ramadan Abdullah for theft, the Muslimâs answers about why he was stealing ammunition raised suspicion among police, who then decided to obtain a search warrant to investigate their suspicions further. During their raid they discovered a massive stockpile of illegal weapons throughout the Islamberg location, including 8 assault weapons, 4 loaded handguns, 1 loaded shotgun, 2 rifles, 64 high-capacity ammunition feeding devices, and body armor, including thousands of rounds of .50 caliber ammunition capable of piercing body armor. But illegal cache of weapons seized at the compound was unfortunately just the beginning.After Abdullahâs arrest, authorities began looking closer into his background, discovering that the Muslim is a long-time associate of the U.S.-based Islamist terrorist organization, Muslims of America (MOA), and was the very same Muslim who was arrested back in 1977 after police discovered enough material at his home to build 50 bombs.here are ISIS training camps across the United States that were protected by the Clintons, Obama, and the Democratic Party. Every compound needs to be raided with every person living at these camps investigated and charged with terrorism. Itâs not hard to do just activate the national guard so they can get some of the training they need.Muslims have training camps that we wonât raid, but the Feds had no problem raiding the compound in Waco, Texas years ago that wound up killing everyone inside including a lot of children under then attorney general Janet Reno now didnât they? But itâs xenophobic to raid a Muslim compound, right?",1
9,SMOKING GUN: Proof That Obama WIRETAPPED Trump,http://www.redrocktribune.com/proof-obama-tapped-trump/,"WHILE SOME ARE FLAT OUT DENYING THAT OBAMA WOULD BE INVOLVED IN WIRETAPPING DONALD TRUMP, SOME EX OBAMA OFFICIALS ARE SUBTLY CONFIRMING THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION DID DO IT!Former spokes person for Obama, Kevin Lewis, released this statement after President Trump tweeted that Obama tapped his phones prior to the election:Of course they would try and cover it up instead of admitting the truth. Everything that Obama and his minions have done thus far has been to smear the name of Donald Trump.From Trump Gone Viral:Interestingly, however, a number of other former Obama administration officials do not deny that such a wiretap existed. They just deny that the White House or Obama himself would have approved it or ordered it, and say that the Department of Justice would have sought it in consultation with a foreign intelligence surveillance, or FISA, court.Obamaâs former speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted that he would warn reporters against saying there was no wiretap.And Favreau endorsed a Twitter feed that laid out the reporting about the existence of the wiretaps, which cited reporting from Louise Mensch, formerly of Heat Street, and The Guardian that the Obama DOJ had sought a FISA court approved surveillance warrant for Trump Tower back in the summer of 2016 that was denied but received a narrower focused warrant in October.David Axelrod, another former Obama adviser, tweeted that such a wiretap would receive court approval âfor a reason.âThey are very obviously not denying that there was a wiretap on President Trump. In fact, their trying to subtly say that they had good reason to tap Trump. Because heâs so corrupt, right?I can already see how theyâre going to flip this one on our President. But the corrupt one is actually Obama! And if President Trump keeps fearlessly moving forward, draining these snakes, America will soon see it too! Those who choose to not be blind, that is.",1

But denial is a crazy thingâ¦ Weâve got high up government officials who are on board with bringing Sharia law and destroying America and we have dim witted citizens who believe everything the mainstream media has to say.Minnesota just made a move that will help the agenda of radical Muslims everywhereâ¦From Freedom daily:Anti-blasphemy laws have been a massive victory for Muslims across the world, as now followers of Islam can have people who speak out or criticize their religion thrown into prison. In an unprecedented and unconstitutional move, liberal politicians Minneapolis, Minnesota, have just set up a hotline where Muslims can call in and report any American who âharassesâ or speaks out against their religion.While this sounds like something youâd read off of a conspiracy website, itâs really happening. According to Minneapolisâ local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to âharass them.â The Star Tribune reported:The city of Minneapolis has set up a hot line for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.The service, operated through the cityâs 311 help line, is aimed to aid targets of any âharassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,â according to a city news release issued on Monday.These lawmakers and judges need to be jailed for treason and that wonât happen until true Americans rise up and put them in there place! The fight is coming and soon. Whether we stand up as a country, supporting the Constitution and our way of life or not, is to be decided. Make no mistake, it is Islamâs goal to control this great land.When are they going to start arresting people who speak against christians and curse God and Jesus? Allow Islam in our schools but not Jesus? This is why America isnât the great land that it once was, this country was founded on christian faith and beliefs.",1
11,Proof that Mass Voter Fraud Swung New Hampshire Election ~,http://www.ini-world-report.org/2017/09/08/proof-that-mass-voter-fraud-swung-new-hampshire-election/,"Republicans have been warning about the dangers of voter fraud for years, and for most of that time Democrats have been pretending that the problem just doesnât exist.Democrats argue that the GOP fixation on voter fraud is all about denying some citizens the right to vote, meanwhile Republicans argue that the Democrats near-monolithic defense of voter fraud is all about winning extra votes. Both arguments have merit, but the Democrats are lying when they pretend that the problem simply doesnât exist.Every election there are countless examples of voter fraud (sometimes even mass voter fraud) that come to light, and this election has been no different. However, the latest shoe to drop on the voter fraud front could be a game changerâ¦ if the national media will pay any attention to the story.In New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton won the vote by the slimmest of margins. Less than 3K votes separated the two candidates. The race for Senator was even closer, and some local elections were decided by just a handful of votes. These facts make what the state government just discovered all the more troubling.State law requires that anyone moving to the state must acquire a new driverâs license within 60 days of establishing residency, but more than 5K 2016 voters have still not done that, leading authorities to believe that these were fraudulent voters who came to the state to influence the outcome of the election.On Nov. 8, 2016, 6,540 voters used an out-of-state driverâs license as identification to vote but as of Aug. 30, 2017, only 1,014 of those individuals â 15.5 percent â had been issued a New Hampshire driverâs license, according to the data.Of the remaining 5,526 individuals, only 3.3 percent â about 213 people â had a registered motor vehicle.That would leave 5,313 people who used an out-of-state license to vote but never obtained a new New Hampshire license despite being required to by state law after implying that they were establishing residency or domicile in the state to vote in November.Of the 5,313 individuals who registered to vote same-day on Election Day, 81 percent â 4,314 people â neither held a New Hampshire driverâs license nor had a registered vehicle in the state ever.With the exception of the gubernatorial race â where Republican Chris Sununu easily bested Democrat Colin Van Ostern by more than 16,000 votes â Democrats won all the other statewide and Congressional races.But three races were determined by less than 5,000 votes: Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, beat incumbent U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte by 1,017 votes â although many have suspected that last minute, illegal campaign mailers pushing votes to independent Aaron Day cost Ayotte the race. Hillary Clinton bested Donald Trump by 2,736, earning the stateâs 4 Electoral College votes even though she ultimately lost the presidency. U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter was sent back to Congress after she bested incumbent U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta by a few more than 4,900 votes.In the grand scheme of things 5K fraudulent votes in a nation of 315 million people may not seem like much, but in a state where 3 of the most important races were decided by less than 5K votes, itâs monumental. Consider the failed Obamacare repeal vote; could Senator Kelly Ayotte have helped the GOP ram repeal through? Or how much help could Rep. Frank Guinta be giving the House GOP if heâd actually defeated his liberal opponent?The state government must continue its investigation and these fraudulent voters must be brought to justice. Voter fraud is a felony and it should be investigated and prosecuted as such.",1
12,Audio: Seymour Hersh States Seth Rich Was WikiLeaks Source,http://www.ini-world-report.org/2017/08/03/more-on-seth-rich-murder/,"In an audio recording provided to Big League Politics by a source that currently wishes to remain anonymous, journalist Seymour Hersh confirms that Seth Rich had contacted WikiLeaks with sample emails from the leak. Hersh cites an FBI document as proof for his claim.âThere are no DNC or Podesta emails that exist beyond May 21 or 22, last email from either one of those groups. What the report says is that some time in late Springâ¦ he makes contact with WikiLeaks, thatâs in his computer,â he says. âAnyway, they found what he had done is that he had submitted a series of documents â of emails, of juicy emails, from the DNC.âHersh explains that it was unclear how the negotiations went, but that WikiLeaks did obtain access to a password protected DropBox where Rich had put the files.âAll I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, Iâm sure dozens of emails, and said âI want money.â Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,â he said. They got access to the DropBox.âHersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him, and hadâThe word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that âif anything happens to me itâs not going to solve your problems,ââ he added. âWikiLeaks got access before he was killed.âThis conversation is the second in a series provided to Big League Politics.Seymour Hersh did not contact the family with his information.In the first audio recording, private investigator Rod Wheeler explains what happened with the Fox News coverage of Seth Rich â and how brother Aaron Rich was actively attempting to shut down anyone looking into the WikiLeaks connection. His story in the audio contradicts reports of White House involvement with the media reports regarding Seth Rich.Wheeler also said that brother Aaron Rich tried to block Wheeler from looking at Sethâs computer, even though there could be evidence on it. âHe said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,â Wheeler said. âI said, well can I look at it?â¦He said, what are you looking for? I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone. He said no, I already checked it. Donât worry about it.â",1
13,THE UNANSWERED MYSTERY OF THE CENTURY!!! A GREAT SIGNIFICANT SERIOUS MYSTERY ~    A MUST READ !!!,http://www.ini-world-report.org/2016/12/21/the-unanswered-mystery-of-the-century/,"(and the answer to the final question below is: âNo! just dumbed-down!!!â)When Obama is out of office it will be interesting to see what they put in his âLibraryâ regarding his early years.   In a country where we take notice of many facets of our public figuresâ lives, doesnât it seem odd that thereâs so little we know about our current man in the White House, Barack Obama?For example, we know that Andrew Jacksonâs wife smoked a corn cob pipe and was accused of adultery.  Abe Lincoln never went to school.  Jack Kennedy wore a back brace.  Harry Truman played the piano.As Americans, we enjoy knowing details about our newsmakers, but none of us know one single amazing fact about the history of our two term president â Barack Hussein Obama.We are all aware of the lack of uncontestable birth records for Obama, because the management of that document has been spectacularly successful.There are however, several additional oddities in Obamaâs history that appear to be as well managed as the birthing issue.Another interesting thing:  There are no birth certificates of his daughters that can be found?Itâs interesting that no one who ever dated him has shown up.  The charisma that caused women to be drawn to him so strongly during his campaign would, in the normal course of events, lead some lady to come forward, if only to garner some attention for herself.  We all know about JFKâs magnetism; that McCain was no monk; quite a few details about Palinâs courtship and even her athletic prowess; Joe Bidenâs aneurisms are no secret;  look at Cheney and Clinton â we all  know about their heart  problems. Certainly Wild Bill Clintonâs exploits before and during his White House years, were well known.  Thatâs why itâs so odd that not one lady has stepped up and said, âHe was soooo shyâ¦â or âWhat a great dancerâ¦âItâs virtually impossible to know anything about this fellow.   Who was the best man at his wedding?   Start there. Then check groomsmen.Then get the footage of his graduation ceremony.   Has anyone talked to the professors?  It is odd that no one is bragging that they knew him or taught him or lived with him.When did he meet Michele, and how?   Are there photos there?  Every president gives to the public all their photos, etc. for their library, etc.    What has he released?    And who voted for him to be the most popular man in 2010?    Doesnât this make you wonder?Ever wonder why no one ever came forward from Obamaâs past saying they knew him, attended school with him, or was his friend ?   Not one person has ever come forward from his past, and that certainly is very, very strange.This should be a cause for great concern.   To those who voted for him, you may have elected an unqualified, inexperienced shadow man.   Have you seen a movie named âThe Manchurian Candidateâ ?   It is a classic, and it is pertinent.As insignificant as each of us might be, someone with whom we went to school will remember our name or face.  Someone will remember we were the clown or the dork or the brain or the quiet one or the bully or something about  us.George Stephanopoulos of ABC News said the same thing during the 2008 campaign.    He questions why no one has acknowledged the president was in their classroom or ate in the same cafeteria or made impromptu speeches on campus.  Stephanopoulos also was a classmate of Obama at Columbia â the class of 1984.  He says he never had a single class with  him.If he is such a great orator; why doesnât anyone in Obamaâs college class remember him?  Why wonât he allow Columbia to release his records?  The fact is that  Nobody remembers Obama at Columbia University.Looking for evidence of Obamaâs past,    Fox News contacted 400 Columbia University students from the period when Obama claims to have been thereâ¦ but none remembered him.Wayne Allyn Root was, like Obama, a political science major at Columbia who also graduated in 1983.    In 2008, Root says of Obama, âI donât know a single person at Columbia that knew him, and they all know me. I donât have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia, ever.âNobody recalls him. Root adds that he was also, like Obama, Class of â83 Political Science, and says, âYou donât get more exact or closer than that. Never met him in my life, donât know anyone who ever met him.    At class reunion, our 20th reunion five years ago, who was asked to be the speaker of the class?   Me.  No one ever heard of Barack!   And five years ago, nobody even knew who he was. The guy who writes the class notes, whoâs kind of the, as we say in New York, âthe machaâ who knows everybody, has yet  to find a person, a human who ever met  him.âAnd Obama consistently declines requests to talk about his years at Columbia, or to provide school records, or provide the name of any former classmates or friends while at Columbia.Some other interesting questions:   Why was Obamaâs law license inactivated in 2002?   It is said there is no record of him ever taking the Bar exam.  and  Why was Michelleâs law license inactivated by court order?   We understand that was forced or required to avoid fraud charges.It is circulating that according to the U.S. Census, there is only one Barack Obama, but there are27 Social Security numbers and over 80 alias connected to him.The Social Security number Obama now uses originated in Connecticut, where Obama is reported to have never lived.   The number was originally registered to another man (Thomas Louis Wood) from Connecticut, who died in Hawaii while on vacation there.   As we all know, Social Security Numbers are only issued once, and they are not reused.   No wonder all his records are sealed !!!Please continue sending this out.  Somewhere, Someone has to know SOMETHING!?!    School? Before he became an âorganizerâ in Chicago?  SOMETHING!!!   He just seemed to burst upon the Scene at the 2004 Democratic Convention.  ANYONE??? ANYWHERE??? ANYTHING???Surely in the near future, when he no longer has the power of the presidency, much will come to light about this highly unqualified person who has been president of the United States for 8 years.  Soon, we will know how badly we were all doped and duped by this imposter who has, with much help from âthose who created him,â nearly brought the greatest nation in history to its knees in ruins.  And that will be his legacy â the man who destroyed the Integrity, Morals and Christian Heritage of our once great country.Who in the hell is this man?  Is America stupid or what?You must forward this email to all of your contacts.  It is vital to the integrity of the United States of America to really know who has been in the White House the past eight years, understand how he was manufactured, and know the details of this essentially successful anti-American, anti-culture, anti-Christian conspiracy.",1

16,Obama Signs Executive Order: Appoints Rashad Hussain As New Supreme Court Justice,http://newsexaminer.net/politics/obama-signs-executive-order-appoints-rashad-hussain-new-supreme-court-justice/,"WASHINGTON â Just two days after the funeral for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last Sunday of a heart attack at the age of 79, President Obama signed Executive Order 14651, which appoints Rashad Hussain as the new Supreme Court Justice to replace Scalia.âWe cannot wait for a new President or the Senate Republicans to fill this vacancy left by Scalia, so I have taken it upon myself to do what needed to be done,â Obama told reporters at a press conference today. âRepublican Senators believe that it is appropriate not to act on such an important matter, and as I have shown today, I do not agree with that.âHussain, of Muslim heritage, is an attorney who has served as US Special Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the second largest intergovernmental body after the UN, and as US Special Envoy for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications. Hussain has also served in the White House Counselâs Office and on the National Security Council as a political appointee of the Obama Administration.Even though under the Constitution, it is the Presidentâs job to nominate Supreme Court justices, Obamaâs selection is already drawing sharp criticism from Republicans. Presidential hopeful Donald Trump told ABC News that he does not agree with the Presidentâs decision.ââHussain is a Muslim and a sympathizer, just like Obama, and now he takes over the legacy the great Antonin Scalia left behind. The President should be ashamed of himself.ââThe American people should have had a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,â Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said. âAppointing a Muslim to replace Scalia is absolutely appalling.âSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Obamaâs decision.âWe needed someone in there to fill that spot as quickly as possible,â Bradley said. âRegardless if you agree with Obamaâs appointed choice of Hussain, Scalia was a disgrace to the Supreme Court. He was a religious radical, a bigot, a racist, against womenâs rights, gay rights and human rights in general; thereâs absolutely no reason a person like that should have ever had power like that in the first place. He will always be remembered as being on the wrong side of history.âDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, who is also currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a âfake news siteâ, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.âThis type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money,â Mikkelson said. âWe use our cookie-cutter outlines, we copy and paste the original article into ours, type in one or two sentences of original content and then we make hella cash. If it wasnât for people like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, my children wouldnât have been able to go to college.âLegal experts believe Republicans will attempt to block Obamaâs appointee until heâs out of office, leaving the court with a gaping vacant seat for nearly a year.âObama has a right to do what he did, but weâll fight him to the end on this,â Tom Downey of the Republican National Lawyers Association told reporters. âThis will not stand, ya know, this aggression will not stand, man.â",1
17,Donald Trump Introduces New Muslim/Refugee Badges; âNazi-Likeâ Plan Requires All Muslims & Refugees To Wear Badges Like The Jews Did During The Holocaust,http://newsexaminer.net/politics/donald-trump-introduces-refugee-muslim-badges/,"Washington, DC â During an interview today with Fox News, Donald Trump unveiled plans making it mandatory for all Muslim people and refugees entering this country, along with those currently residing in the U.S., to wear badges on their outer garments at all times. The 2016 presidential candidate says these badges are necessary so refugees and Muslims can easily be identified and monitored.âThey are a danger to our Christian way of life in America, itâs that simple,â Trump said. âThe Muslims, they want us dead, we know that for a fact. The refugees are joining ISIS and are pouring into our country like that. They both hate our freedom and way of life, you canât argue that. By enforcing and requiring these possible terrorists to wear badges at all time they can be easily identified and tracked if necessary. This is nothing like the badges the Jews had to wear during the Holocaust, that was different, but you know, itâs the same thing. These are tough times right now and Iâm just saying what everyone else is too afraid to say. We can take back America, we just need to work together, itâs never too late.âTrump went further by saying he would put all the Muslims and refugees entering this country on their own land, with critics comparing that to Hitlerâs concentration camps during World War II.âThere is no reason we shouldnât put them all on their own land like how we did with the Indians. We know what these people are capable of and I know Iâm scared, and I know most Americans are too. We need to act now before more innocent lives are lost.âLast week Trump told various news sources he would implement databases to track every Syrian refugee, Muslim and mosque in this country.âWeâre going to have to do things that we never did before,â Trump said in an interview with Yahoo News. âSome people are going to be upset about it, but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule.âAppearing Sunday on ABCâs âThis Weekâ, Trump was asked about the databases.âI want a database for the refugees,â Trump said. âWe have no idea who these people are. When the Syrian refugees are going to start pouring into this country, we donât know if theyâre ISIS, we donât know if itâs a Trojan horse. And I definitely want a database and other checks and balances.âPresident Obama has expanded the usual annual ceiling for refugees of 70,000 by an additional 15,000, with 10,000 of those new slots for Syrians. At the outset, officials said this program for Syrian refugees probably would continue beyond one year. But nothing approaching 250,000, which Trump routinely says, is in the works.Historians of the Third Reich and Nazi Holocaust say that these methods of government control paved the way for the acceptance of the Holocaust by German citizens.âThe German governmentâs policy of forcing Jews to wear identifying badges was but one of many psychological tactics aimed at isolating and dehumanizing the Jews of Europe, directly marking them as being different and inferior to everyone else,â Paul Horner of the Holocaust Center said. âIt allowed for the easier facilitation of their separation from society and subsequent ghettoization, which ultimately led to the deportation and murder of 6 million Jews. What Donald Trump is doing is just the beginning, exactly how Hitler started out. More hate and ignorance is definitely what we donât need in this country right now.â Horner continued, âThe only thing good coming from all of this, is that Trump is keeping comedy writers employed and making cash. This stupid moron is a wet dream for writers of comedy all around the world; itâs not even fair. He writes the story himself, you just have to report what he did and said and your job is done. I truly hope he gets the Republican nomination, we need to keep this cash cow alive. Heâll lose to ANYONE that gets elected on the Democratic side, but until then, we must remember these good times and how backwards him and all of his followers are.âThe yellow badges that were given to the Jews by the Nazis, was a cloth patch sewn on their outer garments that marked them as Jews in public. Intended or not, it served as a badge of shame, making them easily identifiable.",1
18,Trump Incensed by National Parks Serviceâs Plan To Add Barack Obamaâs Face To Mount Rushmore,http://newsexaminer.net/breaking-news/nps-add-obamas-face-mt-rushmore/,"Washington, D.C. (AP) â In a move the Trump administration calls, âjust another example of American carnage,â the National Parks Service admitted today in a press conference they have plans to add the face of former President Barack Obama to the Mount Rushmore National Monument.President Trump found out about the plan three days ago when an aide was accidentally CCâed on an NPS email. In a late-night press conference held yesterday, Trump hammered the NPS.âThis is nothing short of treason,â Trump said, slamming his fist against the podium. âAnd where did they get these workers? Mexico? Iraq? Iâll be damned if the NPS lets rapists and criminals into our country to deface one of our nationâs iconic landmarks.âHenry Murphy, a spokesman from the NPS, met with reporters this morning in the wake of Trumpâs scathing criticism. Murphy said the organizationâs leaders have been planning to add Obamaâs face for more than six months.The new construction is classified as a âprogressive renovationâ of the chunk of rock next to the bust of Abraham Lincoln. It will begin next week, Murphy said.âWeâre hoping to have the project completed by the summer of 2018, just in time for President Trumpâs impeachment,â Murphy said during the press conference. âEverything is set. The workers are hired, sketches are done and weâre ready to launch the project. I donât care what the Trump administration says; weâve got funding and weâre moving forward.âWhen asked how the NPS would pay for the project, Murphy danced around an answer. In a follow-up question, Murphy admitted that the parks service backdoored money from contributions to the Environmental Protection Agencyâs global-warming research fund.âThereâs a loophole in legislation that allows the EPA to channel research funds to âcauses deemed necessaryâ without getting congressional approval,â Murphy said. âWhat weâve done is fully legal and necessary.âMurphy went on to say the NPS channeled the money to an unnamed investor who, according to sources, is the same investor who paid for protesters to block the construction of the Dakota Pipeline project.That investor provided some 300 workers for the Mount Rushmore project; all off the books, according to the NPS. A source close to one of the projectâs organizers said all but five of the workers double as pipeline protesters.âCall it what you want, but we felt like this was the right thing to do,â Murphy said. âBarackâs face was slim enough, our artists told us, to squeeze it in right next to Lincoln.âThe NPS said they are prepared to launch a series of tweets about the matter in the next few days.Hector Guthrie, one of the artists involved in the project, said he was proud of the work but that there was a lot of battling back and forth about what should and shouldnât be added to the sculpture.âA few people in the group were worried about the birther arguments that inevitably would come up once the project is done,â Guthrie said. âSo, we decided to etch Obamaâs birth certificate across his forehead in both English and Arabic. The letters would be really small, though, so you wouldnât be able to see them unless you were up close.â",1
19,Ted Cruz: âI Will Endorse Donald Trump For President If He Makes Masturbation Illegalâ,http://newsexaminer.net/politics/ted-cruz-will-endorse-donald-trump-president-makes-masturbation-illegal/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) â U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation. The Senator called this âThe single most important issue facing the country todayâ and that without âswift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self-satisfactionâ.âSelf-love is a silent killer in this country. This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path. It starts innocently enough with a JC Penney catalogue tucked under your mattress, but it quickly spirals out of control, and before you know it, your mother has to call the coroner because youâve died from auto-erotic asphyxiation. Iâm not saying that we should lock up these one armed bandits and throw away the key; what we need is a compassionate approach that helps these deviants reform and become productive members of society. That is why I believe a prison sentence of three to five years will help motivate these heathens to change their evil ways and stay off the Devilâs playground for good,â Cruz said. âIâm asking Mr. Trump to acknowledge the severity of this problem, and commit to finding real solutions. If he does that, I will do whatever it takes to help him secure the White House in November. Should Mr. Trump decline, I think itâs safe to say that all options, including a third party run, are out on the table.âDonald Trump told ABC News that he was open to the idea, though he refused to take a clear stand on the issue.âLook, do I think Ted Cruz is right about this? Maybe he is, maybe he isnât. To be honest, I donât know a lot about this subject matter. I donât need to. I have a wife that takes care of this for me, and sheâs a beautiful wife, the best wife, the greatest wife. My people are going to take a hard look into this matter and find a great answer for it, the best answer there is. I want an endorsement from Senator Cruz, and I think I can go along with his request that makes pleasuring your genitalia for non-reproductive purposes illegal.âThis is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of self-stimulation. As solicitor general of Texas in 2007 he fought to uphold the stateâs ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no âRight to stimulate oneâs genitals.â Cruz eventually lost this battle, but the story re-surfaced this year and gained widespread media attention, prompting Cruzâs former college roommate Craig Mazin to tweet that Cruzâs stance against stimulating oneâs own genitals was âA new belief of hisâ, implying that much of Cruzâs time in college was, in fact, spent stimulating his own genitals. Another one of Cruzâs former college roommates, Matt Daemon, has recently come forward to corroborate Mazinâs story.âAll Ted Cruz did was take care of little Ted Cruz back then, which is fine I guess, but he was always real creepy about doing it. Honestly, I lost track of the number of times I came home to find him laying on the couch naked, lotion and Kleenex next to him, watching re-runs of Walker Texas Ranger. He wouldnât even try and cover up when I caught him, he would just stare at me in the eyes and continue until I left the room. Itâs absolutely hilarious about the tough stance on touching oneâs self that Ted has taken in this country. I truly believe he may have pulled on it one too many times and it broke or something and now feels that if he canât do it anymore, then no one can.âSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by the Republican party.âIt is absolutely disgusting that in this day in age, a creepy weirdo like Ted Cruz was almost elected as the GOP nomination for President,â Bradley said. âWith all the real problems in this country like starvation, so many people out of work and families living on the street, Cruz is focused on making pleasuring yourself a crime.â Bradley continued, âAlso, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps.âCruz, however, remains undeterred by his detractors. âWhen you play with your Devil stick or ring the Devilâs doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep, and they are weeping for this country 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. America needs strong moral leadership, and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task. The fate of our great nation is in his hands; hopefully, theyâre big enough to handle it.âMost pundits expect Trump to answer Cruzâs call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter. A recent poll by the New York Times found that 43% of likely Trump voters support a ban on self-stimulation due to moral and religious concerns. Another 46% would be okay with a ban, saying that they, like Trump, have far too many potential suitors, and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges. Only 11% of Trump supporters are against a ban.RNC political strategist, 37-year-old Paul Horner, calls the move a âno-brainerâ and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz.âConservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue. If Donald does not side with the Senator, he risks alienating the partyâs Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Clinton. Trump needs to agree with Cruz on this one, no matter how creepy, insane and absolutely horrible of a person he is.âRegardless of which side Trump takes on the issue, it is certain to invoke heated debate on both sides of the political aisle.

20,Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All Book,http://newsexaminer.net/entertainment/secret-service-agent-says-obama-is-gay-muslim/,"Washington, DC â A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazonâs best-seller charts, said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief, Barack Obama.Former agent, Paul Horner, in his new tell-all book âThe Black House,â reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off.In an interview with NBC News, Horner told Senior Political Analyst Tom Downey that he is one-hundred-percent positive that President Obama is not only gay, but a radical Muslim as well.âEveryone on the inside knows that Obama is gay and a Muslim, it is common knowledge,â Horner said. âI saw many men coming and going from Obamaâs room, at all hours. I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim.âDowney: âIn your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule. Can you elaborate on these for our viewers?âHorner: âWhen no one was around, except his security, Obama couldnât wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic. He would wear it while praying to the prophet Muhammad throughout the day. During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed.âDowney: âYour book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various âtorturesâ that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to. Can you explain?âHorner: âBecause I was white, Obama would force me to listen to Diana Ross at full volume, every day, at all hours of the night. It was horrible, I never got any sleep. This is one of the main reasons I finally had to quit.âDowney: âCan you give us any insight on Obamaâs feelings towards the American people?âHorner: âHe constantly made jokes about Americans, frequently referring to them as âmongoloidsâ and âidiotsâ. Christians were his favorite verbal punching bags. He has absolutely no respect for the Christian religion. I believe he actually hates Christians, and finds their ideology to be old fashioned and ignorant.âDowney: âWhat are some of the things the public will find the most shocking?âHorner: âProbably the sheer amount of men he welcomed into his bed quarters. I am in no way homophobic, but Obamaâs insatiable lust for homosexual liaisons is like nothing Iâve ever witnessed. Weâre talking 10-15 partners in a single day.âDowney: âThatâs amazing, 10-15 in a single day? Wow.âHorner: âAlso, at least once a day, Obama would have us log on to Facebook and report a page about a Dolphin named Fappy who travels around the country speaking to elementary school children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. It was all very, very strange stuff.âDowney: âIs there anything else you can tell us?âHorner: âYeah (Horner smiles), buy the book.âTo read more, pick up a copy of Hornerâs book, The Black House, now available on Amazon and at your local bookstore.",1
21,Newly Leaked Report Shows Hillary DID NOT Win New Hampshireâ¦And Dems Are PANICKING,http://usinfonews.com/index.php/2017/09/10/newly-leaked-report-shows-hillary-not-win-new-hampshireand-dems-panicking/,"President Trump won the election fair and square, but more and more evidence keeps piling up that his big win might have been in spite of Democratic voter fraud. First there was the study suggesting millions of non-citizens voted, now there appears to be evidence that thousands of non-residents may have actually given a whole state to Hillary Clinton. New Hampshire House Speaker Shawn Jasper (R) reported numbers on Thursday that indicate more than 6,500 people registered to vote in New Hampshire using out-of-state drivers licenses, Washington Times reports. Since the election, many of those people, most of whom were from nearby Massachusetts, never got an in-state license. Some have suggested the stateâs same-day registration rules could be to blame, as people from Massachusetts- a solidly blue state- could travel to New Hampshire, vote, and then leave in one day. White House Policy Advisor Stephen Miller was unsurprised by Jasperâs findings, saying: âHaving worked before on a campaign in New Hampshire, I can tell you that this issue of busing voters into New Hampshire is widely known by anyone whoâs worked in New Hampshire politics. Itâs very real. Itâs very serious. This morning, on this show, is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence.â Leave it to Democrats to travel from miles around just to tell other people how they should be governed, in a state they donât even live in. Hereâs the three numbers you need to know: 6,540 people registered and voted on the same day- November 8th, by showing out-of-state licenses.  About 5,300 of those people had not received a New Hampshire driverâs license or registered a vehicle in New Hampshire several months later.  President Trump lost New Hampshire by 2,736 votes.  This seems like pretty strong evidence of suspicious voting activity, with real consequences for elections. Donât be surprised if you donât hear the media advertise this though, and this absolutely needs to get out there- so SHARE it LOUD and PROUD, Patriots!",1
22,Uncovered Voter Fraud In New Hampshire Tipped State For Hillary,http://yournewswire.com/voter-fraud-new-hampshire-hillary/,"Nearly 7,000 illegal voters were found to have voted for Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire on November 8, according to official figures.6,540 people registered to vote using out-of-state driverâs licenses, the majority of which did not obtain an in-state license nor register a motor vehicle.According to New Hampshire House Speaker Shawn Jasper, the voter fraud that took place last November tipped the State in Hillary Clintonâs favor.Washingtontimes.com reports: Since Election Day, Republicans have charged that a significant number of nonresident Democrats, principally from Massachusetts, flowed into New Hampshire to vote illegally, tilting a close race to their party.âHaving worked before on a campaign in New Hampshire, I can tell you that this issue of busing voters into New Hampshire is widely known by anyone whoâs worked in New Hampshire politics. Itâs very real. Itâs very serious. This morning, on this show, is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence,â White House policy adviser Stephen Miller told ABC News in February.Though Mr. Jasperâs findings donât prove those accusations, they do corroborate them. The numbers read this way:6,540 people registered and voted on Nov. 8, based on presenting out-of-state licenses.As of Aug. 30, about 15 percent (1,014 of the voters) had been issued New Hampshire driverâs licenses.Îf the remaining 5,526, barely more than 200 (3.3 percent) had registered a motor vehicle in New Hampshire.New Hampshire law gives drivers 60 days upon establishing residence to obtain a state license.But more than 80 percent of voters who registered on Nov. 8 using out-of-state driverâs licenses, or 5,313 of them, neither had a state license nor registered a motor vehicle almost 10 months later.Double voting is illegal, and 196 people are being investigated for casting ballots in New Hampshire and in other states.In the presidential race, Democrat Hillary Clinton defeated Republican Donald Trump in New Hampshire by 2,736 votes. In an even tighter race, for the Granite Stateâs U.S. Senate seat, Democratic challenger Maggie Hassan defeated incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte by 1,017 votes.Logan Churchwell, spokesman for Public Interest Legal Foundation, which investigates voter fraud, said Mr. Jasperâs numbers bolster his groupâs findings that many people vote in New Hampshire without proof of residence.âWeâve known for months that more voters cast ballots without any proof of actually living in New Hampshire than the differentials for either federal contest there in 2016,â he said. âNow it looks like they were back in Boston in time to watch the election returns that evening. The left-wing groups suing to block new proof-of-residence laws for same-day voter registration are really proving what drives them to the courthouse.âProject Veritas, a conservative investigative unit, took hidden cameras to New Hampshire for the 2016 February primary.Poll workers told Veritas operatives that they did not need to live in the state to vote, that they could use a Massachusetts driverâs license and that they could fill out a form if they had no ID.âIf youâre here today, you can vote and be gone,â one poll official unwittingly told Veritas.A spokesman for Mr. Jasper said the speaker was presenting raw data and did not know which states issued the 6,540 licenses and acknowledged that the numbers could include some college students.In February, while meeting with senators at the White House, Mr. Trump said he lost New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents crossed state lines to vote. He also said Ms. Ayotte lost for the same reason: illegal voting.The liberal media dismissed his accusations. The Boston Globe called them âgroundless.âThe president has appointed a special commission to investigate voter integrity, led by Vice President Mike Pence.By coincidence, New Hampshire will host the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrityâs first meeting outside Washington on Tuesday. Vice Chairman Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, will preside.Democrats oppose the panel and have called for its demise.At least two scientific surveys show that a larger number of noncitizens register and vote illegally in U.S. elections. One poll found that a large majority vote Democrat.Mr. Jasper said in a statement that he requested the driverâs license and motor vehicle information âto benefit the legislature in its assessment of the effectiveness of our current election laws as well as future legislation that could improve our voter registration and verification processes.âThe two state departments, State and Safety, provided the data to Mr. Jasper on Wednesday in a joint letter.Secretary of State William M. Gardner, a Democrat, signed the letter. Also signing was John Barthelmes, the Republican appointed commissioner for the Department of Safety.The two agencies explained the 5,313 number (neither a driverâs license nor a registered motor vehicle many months later) with several possible reasons.âIt is likely that some unknown number of these individuals moved out of New Hampshire, it is possible that a few may have never driven in New Hampshire or have ceased driving, however, it is expected that an unknown number of the remainder continue to live and drive in New Hampshire. If they have established their residence in New Hampshire, they may have failed to obtain a New Hampshire driverâs license.âNowhere in the letter do the departments suggest that out-of-state people voted illegally.The letter contains another interesting fact: There were 6,033 people who signed domicile affidavits in order to register to vote. The secretary of state sent letters to all of them, and the U.S. Postal Service returned 458 of them as not delivered to the address on the registration forms.",1
23,Hurricane Matthew Was Called âHurricane Hillaryâ Until Obama Banned Name,http://yournewswire.com/hurricane-matthew-hillary/,"Hurricane Matthew, the devastating storm that left a trail of dead in Haiti and the Caribbean last year, was originally named âHurricane Hillary,â until the Obama White House intervened and demanded the name changed.âThere is a strict procedure for naming hurricanes,â claims a source at the World Meteorological Organization, âand when we saw the storm brewing just east of the Lesser Antilles, we knew she was going to be a real nasty piece of work. We decided to use the name Hurricane Hillary. But the White House caught wind of this and we had to change it real fast. So it became Matthew.âHurricane Matthew, originally dubbed âHurricane Hillary,â was powerful and devastating Category 5 Atlantic hurricane that wrought widespread destruction and catastrophic loss of life during its journey across the Western Atlantic, including parts of Haiti, Cuba, and the southeastern United States.According to Wikipedia, a total of 603 deaths were attributed to the storm, including 546 in Haiti, 47 in the United States, 4 in Cuba, 4 in the Dominican Republic, 1 in Colombia, and 1 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.Hurricane Matthew tore through the Caribbean, leaving hundreds of dead people in its wake. âHere in the office we still think it should have been named Hurricane Hillary.âHurricanes have been given menâs and womenâs names in the United States since 1978. Senior meteorologists choose names for a given storm from a pre-prepared list of options.For Atlantic hurricanes, there is a list of names for each of six years. In other words, one list is repeated every seventh year. The only time that there is a change is if a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for reasons of sensitivity.âWe knew this was going to be a deadly storm and the name would be retired. So we chose Hillary. We didnât expect the White House would ever get involved in the naming of a hurricane.ââThey said, âIn an election year, are you freaking kidding? Change that name now or you will all be out of jobs. Donât even think of attempting another prank like thisâ.â",1

After being greeted by reporters, one man stepped forward introducing himself as a commentator from the conservative new station FOX News.Yakoobi asked the President about future restrictions on Muslims into the U.S. and at that moment, the man grabbed a tire iron from the sidewalk and hit Trump in the head, knocking him unconscious.The terrorist was immediately restrained by Secret Service and Trump was taken to the hospital for examination. President Trump is recovering well, but being monitored for a concussion.Yakoobi is being held and questioned. No terror organization has claimed responsibility for this attack as of yet.

Couric, who was in a conversation with Clinton during commercial, was the only other witness to the hot mic gaffe. After being casually asked how she was doing since the election, Clinton made reference to âthat f*cking orange baboonâ and referred to Barack Obama as âthat n*gger Obama.â Couric was so offended she refused to continue. Clinton was asked to leave but on the way out her goons stopped at the sound booth and confiscated all footage, both audio and video, from lead engineer Chuck Halstead. Halstead said his sound guy, Myron Beetlethong, heard the entire conversation and recorded it but that only Katie herself could corroborate.She did so this morning.

You have been tracked your entire life.âRFID Microchips are essentially a unique ID embedded in your body, and, as we know, numbers can be stolen and data can be hacked,â says University of Wollongong Prof. Katina Michael. âThey point to an uber-surveillance society that is big brother on the inside looking out. Governments or large corporations have the ability to track peopleâs actions and movements, and ultimately even control them.âThis leaked information is expected to cause a major uproar in citizens of the United States born from 1983 to current.How will you know if you have it? Can you get it removed? Who is tracking us?These are the questions hoping to be answered, as we learn more about the governmentâs hidden tactics to control the American Society over the last 32 years.",1

However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring âejaculation is murderâ and they want strict laws against the practice.âLife begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control,â said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. âGod made menâs semen for a purpose, and you can just âwasteâ that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!âStratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. âMillions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!â A petition on Change.org to stop the âneedless wasting of sperm through self gratificationâ has already received 85,000 signatures in less than three weeks. The petition needs 100,000 signatures before it is reviewed and responded by the White House. This week, 38 White House conservatives say they would pass the bill if given the opportunity to do so â all 38 of them are women.",1

Police say he was stabbed multiple times and had a gunshot wound to the head. A neighbor of Zimmerman said she heard a commotion, looked over the wall and saw him lifeless on the ground. Thatâs when she called 911.The murder of George Zimmerman happened Just hours after Zimmerman found himself in a fight provoked by his boasting of being âThat guy who shot Trayvon Martin.â  Zimmerman became known to America for killing 17-year-old Martin. Martin, an African-American carrying a package of skittles and a can of Arizona iced tea while wandering through a Sanford, Florida neighborhood, was unarmed when Zimmerman fatally shot him on February 26, 2012. On July 13, 2013, Zimmerman was acquitted by a Florida jury, which sparked nationwide protests about the acquittal and Floridaâs controversial âstand your groundâ law.Police say, as of now, they have no leads in the murder of George Zimmerman. However, they are confident that his murder had everything to do with his bragging about the death of Martin. Authorities say his constant bragging of the fact that he was acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin finally caught up to him. âYou can run if you want,â said police chief Robert Gordon. âBut your wrongs will catch up to you eventually.â",1

Harvard has a strict no drug policy. Massachusetts is one of the states that now allows for recreational marijuana and the hotel is âweed friendly,â but that doesnât change the fact that she broke the rules.Maliaâs lawyer has pointed out that the school has turned the other way on the marijuana issue when their entire rowing team, made up of 14 white males, was caught selling and smoking marijuana cigarettes during the offseason. Chancellor Little remarked that the difference was that the members of the rowing team are hard-working, established students whose parents are paying cash for their education while Malia hasnât attended yet, isnât planning on playing a sport and is going to the school on a combination of a scholarship from the Clinton Foundation and taxpayer-funded grants.The Obama family lawyer is planning on filing a discrimination suit, because isnât everything about race?",1

Those laws may be acceptable to savages, but here in America, we have higher standards.President Trump used an old precedent and an executive order to remove al Allalawaralahali-Smith from the bench, citing gross negligence of his duties and wanton disregard for the United States Constitution. The Muslim can ask for a Congressional hearing if he so desires, but that will likely get him nowhere since he is the first and only person ever to allow the religious doctrine from another culture rule the country.Democrats are crying foul, saying that since the appointment wasnât Trumpâs, he canât use the precedent heâs using to fire him. Trump responded that people always want him to think about the Office in these situations.

She proved it yet again Sunday night when the two came face to face in New York City. Gaga, or GooGoo as she should be called, proved yet again that she has no class, shouting âwhoreâ and âgo back to YOUR countryâ at Melania from across a sidewalk being cleared by the Secret Service.Mrs. Trump, class act that she is, simply smiled at the overrated pop star, which seemed to enrage the little ball of hate even more.

On Trumpâs orders, one of Obamaâs most secretive rituals is being reversed and all signs of it removed from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.For the past 7 years, to appease any Muslims working at or visiting the White House, silence has been ordered during the five times of Islamic prayer each day. In addition, prayer rugs and crescent moon symbols are available in several areas of the executive mansion to make Muslims more comfortable.The administration has defended the practice by asserting that it also observes several other religious moments of silence and prayer out of respect, including a full 15 seconds for Christianity on Sunday morning while a chaplain blesses a staff breakfast. None of the prayer is mandatory or led by a government official, which has allowed the administration to subvert 1st Amendment issues, but the obvious favoritism towards Islam, which is observed for 25 minutes per day seven days a week, tells a story this president has denied for eight years.President-Elect Trump, who acknowledges that this country was founded by Christians and was built on Christian morals, is having all pagan symbols removed from the property unless they offer some historical significance. Only the cross in the White House chapel will remain for worship. Jim Mergernerlerny, head of the team that will transform the White House from the Obamaâs home to the Trumpâs second home, told MSNBC:âMr. Trump doesnât see the need to provide prayer rugs and false idols is a house built by Christians. Washington DC offers a diverse cultural center for worship of any kind. You wonât find any special considerations for Judaism or crucifixes to appease Catholics, either. There is a simple chapel with a single cross on one wall that is suitable for prayer by anyone. Our government doesnât need to be forcing prayer rituals down peopleâs throats just so we donât âoffendâ people looking to blow us up.âPatriots around the US can rest assured that the era of apologizing for our faith has come to an end.",1

In July, Election Justice USA, for example, reported that without Clintonâs team committing egregious acts of voter fraud, Sanders would have been the man to lose to Donald Trump in the national election. Instead, we have Pantsuits McCriminal, and what happened Friday is absolute proof that she will do literally anything to win.Fox 10 Phoenix reports that nine illegal immigrants complete with fake identification and voter registration cards, and stolen social security numbers, voted at around 9 am a Desert Wind Middle School in Pinal County. At 10:30, the very same white van carrying the very same illegals was spotted at Santa Rosa Elementary School and they voted there as well. Just two hours later, the same group showed up at the Global Water Center to cast their vote.By this point, poll workers had been notified and one of those Poll Watchers liberals hate so much pretended to take a poll and asked them whom they had voted for. In broken English, one man who identified himself as Jose Gutierrez said âI am voting for Hillary Clinton many times.âAnd vote many times he did. Mr. âGutierrezâ and friends voted in two more locations, their spree ending in Maricopa County where a Sheriff was waiting for them. The nine beloved âundocumented personsâ as Democrats call them were arrested and charged with attempted in-person voter fraud and several other charges. Unfortunately, only one will be deported.âThey were just enthusiastic. Most of these people do not have criminal records before this,â an immigration official says, âwith the exception of Enrique Calderon of Mexico.â The official explained that Calderon is wanted on two counts of rape and six counts of drug trafficking back in Mexico, where he will be returning soon.Why arenât the rest being sent back with him?

In addition to her 214 personal assistants, 32 gardeners, 11 dog walkers and her own mother on the government payroll as a âday care provider,â Moochelle also purchased $11 million worth of new furniture, an airplane, four yachts and two limousines with taxpayer money. Whatâs worse is that after she left, she decided she should be able to keep all of that stuff, even though technically it belongs to the American people. After an audit by the White House budget office, President Trump ordered that Michelle Obama be sent a bill for everything she should have paid for by herself but used government money instead. The bill, which totals eleventy billion dollars, is more than the Obama family will likely be able to afford in their lifetime. The tab includes $10 billion for vacations and the balance in food, clothing, liquor and cigarettes that should have been paid for out of their own pockets. The planes, boats and cars have been repossessed but they still have to pay for their use, wear and tear and fuel consumption. President Trump isnât messing around, either.

50,Trump Signs Law To Lower The Age Of Consensual Sex To 13 Years Of Age,http://now8news.com/trump-signs-law-lower-age-consensual-sex-13-years-age/,"Washington, D.C. â An announcement was made on Wednesday by the Trump Administration which states a new law that will take effect January 2, 2018 and Americans are shocked and disappointed. According to the announcement, the law concerning the age of consent will be changed across all 50 states and D.C. Currently the law varies in each state with the age of consent being 16, 17, and 18 years old with age provisions and mistake of age defense clauses. Currently, according to lawyers and court officials across the US, these varying laws cause confusion from state to state. This new law is looking to create a uniformed, understood age of consent factor across the entire country. The lowered age of consent means that an individual can have sex with whomever they wish as long as that person is consenting and they are the same age or older. To have sex with someone under the age of consent is a strict liability crime known as statutory rape. It is often referred to by other names such as sexual assault, sexual misconduct with a child, etc. Many states have age-gap provisions that legalize teen sexuality as long as they are within a certain age range. This new law will do away with that age-gap provision. In all states, dating, hugging, holding hands and kissing are not illegal. In some states, fondling, groping through close or other such things known as âthird-baseâ is illegal. This new law will make any and all contact legal as long as the child is 13 years of age or older. Now that they have done away with the age-gap provision, a 19-year-old boy can legally have sex with a 13-year-old girl without suffering any legal consequences as long as they both consent to the act.",1
51,New Government Program Provides FREE GAS CARDS To Welfare Recipients,http://now8news.com/welfare-gas/,"First it was Obama Care, Obama Phones, Obama Weed and now Obama Gas. Yes, you heard that right. The White House has quietly used a provision in the law to roll out a nationwide program of free gas for the poor. According to The Detroit News, the Obama administration is using its authority under the Affordable Care Act to âimprove transportation routes to hospitalsâ. This would make it possible for welfare recipients to receive these preloaded gas cards. This is a $2 billion a year program that will distribute 40 million gallons of gasoline for FREE each year. It will be dispensed at any gas station that participates in the program by accepting this form of payment. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) will be operating the network.  Over 3,000 gas stations in 38 states have been approved to accept this payment in their stores.Dori Salcido, assistant DHHS Sec. for Public Affairs explained, âIt is not something we are publicizing very much, for obvious reasons. But under the law we are well within our rights to offer this service and we think itâs good public policy. How are people supposed to get to the doctors office if they donât have gas in their cars? Health insurance is worthless if you canât make it to your appointments. This is just another fine example of government stepping in and solving big problems.âThis type of program has worked well in oil-rich nations like Venezuela and Indonesia where they subsidize gas for the poor. However, this practice has never been tried here in the United States. This is causing much controversy with some taxpayers who are upset to see their money subsidizing others. One taxpayer, Ross Blake, shared his thoughts, âSo basically Iâm being punished for not living in the ghetto. I have three kids and a mortgage. Life isnât cheap for me either. I could use some free gasoline too.â A person like Blake will unlikely be able to use this service cardâAccess to this gas card is determined by income,â says Ebony Jackson, a caseworker at he Department of Health and Human Services. âIf you are receiving food stamps or cash assistance from the government, you will be approved. All you need to do is apply. The card will supply anywhere from $50 per month to $150 per month in free gas depending on the individualâs income. If they have no income, benefits will max out at $250 per month. This will help the unemployed person go to and from job interview.â The gas card scandal was uncovered by Nolan Finley, a conservative Detroit News columnist widely known for his groundbreaking exposÃ© on Obama Phones. Finley says, âThere is a blatant economical bias in the program and that is only one of its many outrageous aspects. The President is only trying to increase his popularity. This is something you normally only see in Third World countries. Iâve never been more scared for our democracy.â",1
52,Hillary Clinton Busted in the Middle of Huge Pedophilia Ring Cover Up  At State Department,http://24wpn.com/index.php/2017/04/29/hillary-clinton-busted-in-the-middle-of-huge-pedophilia-ring-cover-up-at-state-department-video/,"An NBC news report claims that Hillary Clinton, while secretary of state, shut down an investigation into an elite pedophile ring in State Department ranks in order to avoid scandal and protect the careers of high ranking officials and an ambassador. The NBC investigation was broadcast at a time when they were a real news organization rather than a branch of the Democratic Partys PR department, and provided internal State Department memos to back up claims of a massive Hillary Clinton elite pedophile ring cover-up. Serious allegations concerning the State Department, the NBC anchor announced, before launching into the disturbing details that mainstream media would be unable to report on in 2017. According to internal State Department memos the agency might have called off or intervened into investigations into possibly illegal, inappropriate behavior within its ranks allegedly to protect jobs and avoid scandals. This concerns a time when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. There is an old saying in Washington that the cover-up is worse than the crime. But in this case both parts of it are disturbing, Chuck Todd continued.Allegations of prostitution and pedophilia, and allegations that those crimes were somehow covered up or not looked into. So the State Department this morning is having to respond to those claims, and those investigations involve misconduct by State Department officials, including an Ambassador and security agents attached to then secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.The allegations are that these investigations were whitewashed, quashed altogether, and that those orders came from high up. NBC has obtained documents relating to ongoing investigations into some disturbing allegations involving State Department personnel and at least one ambassador. A State Department memo says, quote, the Ambassador routinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children.The memo also says a top State Department official directed State Department investigators to cease the investigation into the ambassadors conduct. Its just one of what another document describes as several examples of undue influence from top State Department officials. Elite pedophile ring In contrast to Clintons cover-up, President Trump has announced a federal investigation into the elite pedophile scandal involving human trafficking earlier this month and promised to help put an end to the horrific, really horrific crimes taking place. The president held a short, dramatic press conference after meeting with human trafficking experts to announce that he will direct the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to devote more resources and personnel to the investigation. Appearing at the press conference for less than two minutes, President Trump said that the issue has been on the radar of federal government for some time but since taking office in January the investigation has become much more focused. It has been much more focused over the last four weeks, I can tell you that.",1
53,SEALS Needed To Protect Trump From Assassination After What He Just BOLDLY Risked His Life To Do,http://theexaminer.site/2017/07/28/seals-needed-protect-trump-assassination-just-boldly-risked-life/,"When Donald Trump ran for office as a non-career politician his allegiance to the American people and not special interest groups or big donors was clear. He perpetually shows his patriotism to the United States and commitment to citizens counting on him. President Trump knows that being the leader of this nation comes at a huge cost in many different ways, but was worth the price to restore this country he loves. In the six months since hes been in office, everything hes done has been in the best interest of the American people which has caused a huge but needed, upheaval in Washington, D.C.The establishment in Washington doesnt like someone like Trump in the greatest position of control since he poses a risk of exposing political secrets. At the root of power is money and when thats threatened, people tend to do desperate things. Weve seen this with the ever-increasing body count of people tied to the Clintons and their various political scandals, who seemed to have information that this political power couple didnt want out. It has also been theorized that former President John F. Kennedy wrote his death warrant because of a move he was brave enough to make as Commander-in-Chief that some believe led to his assassination. If this was truly the case and history repeats itself, President Trump could need protection from Special Operations to ensure his safety after what hes rumored to be risking his life to do.Despite the differences in their political affiliation, Kennedy and Trump have a lot of similarities as presidents. According to PragerU, both want lower taxes for Americans, oppose abortion, supported gun rights, and they each sincerely support a strong military. In addition to the Constitution-honoring ideas, they have both expressed a desire to look into the Federal Reserve.Some believe that Kennedys interesting in ending the Fed is what led to his assassination to avoid that from happening, although this is unsubstantiated and still considered a conspiracy theory. He was hardly past his first thousand days in the White House when he was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963, AnonHQ reported. Competing conclusions of the Warren Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and a team of retired secret service officers have failed to provide clarity over the precise circumstances of JFKs assassination  even after 53 years.The theory comes from a speech he gave in his first 100 days which some say sealed his fate, with thoughts on transparency and honesty in government that sound extremely familiar to what were seeing with our assertive and capable leader today. Most specifically and important is the shared interest that Kennedy and Trump have in creating real checks and balances within the Federal Reserve.AnonHQ explains of Kennedys last speech before his assassination:He didnt want to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up government mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserved to know. He wanted the press to inform, to arouse, to reflect, to lead, and to even anger public opinion. The hard hitting speech obviously didnt go down well with the system and the powerful elite at the helm who felt threatened by JFKs ideas.Then, on June 4, 1963, John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 11110. The order called for the issuance of $4,292,893,815 in United States Notes through the U.S. treasury rather than the Federal Reserve System  the central banking system of the United States, which is neither federal nor a system owned by the government; it is a private entity.While it has been said that Kennedy wanted to end the Federal Reserve and many have wondered if this idea led to his assassination to protect the those who they feel must profit from this organization, this government agency hasnt been looked at since. Now, with Trump in office, a bill has been put forth to audit this agency, which would be history-making if his passes.A bill that Republicans have been attempting to push through the House is gaining new momentum under President Trump. The crafters of Americas government decided hundreds of years ago that we would operate with three branches of equal power, creating a system of checks and balances.  As our government has expanded, some oversight has been lost. Laws have been created to keep transparency out of certain parts of government operations, although some debate this assertion.For years, House Republicans have attempted to create an auditing system that would break through the veil of secrecy inside the Federal Reserves monetary policy.  Senator Rand Paul, is a huge advocate for this bill. He believes that the Government Accountability Office should have oversight into how the Fed deals with foreign banks and many other issues where the Fed has complete autonomy.Because our government is so large and empowered, there has to be some oversight in how they operate.  Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen completely disagrees with this bill, claiming that she feels oversight will politicize the Fed and cause far more harm than good. President Trump has heaped scorn on the Fed, saying that it lacks oversight on how it deals with interest rates and that affect the overall economy.Our president doesnt make excuses for what he thinks needs to be done, he moves forward with what he genuinely feels is in the best interest of Americans and the future of our country. Share if you agree that there needs to be more transparency within the Federal Reserve!",1

No, they dont want to live the American dream, but take it. Most Muslims come to this country to shoot and run over innocent people just because they want. America went through hell during Obamas presidency, because the former president didnt fight against terrorists. Moreover, he armed them. Have you ever seen Obama do anything to blast terrorists? No, he supported Muslims and gave them more rights than Americans will ever have. Now Muslims are trying to plant their Sharia law in every institution across the country. Is this what Obama referred to when he said that Muslims are here to assimilate? This law is the most terrible of them all. According to this law, you can get killed for being a gay, and rape victims cant do anything to punish rapists. Can you believe this? President Donald Trump will never allow anything like this, and he was clear about this during his presidential campaign. The good news is that the House passed a new bill that bans the application of foreign law. Democrats and Muslims arent quite happy about it, and they complain that the new bill only targets Muslims, and approves xenophobia and racism. Really? Weve heard a lot of discussions about this being a religious law and specifically directed at preventing Sharia law and I just dont read it that way, explained Republican Theresa Hamilton. Sandy Montgomery had a similar opinion. We have allowed legal immigrants, illegal immigrants and now refugees to take advantage of our law and culture to take up their own agendas. They have no intention to abide by our laws, nor are they interested in assimilating to our culture, she said. What do you think about this bill? Will Muslims protest again?",1

And he stated to him that around four or five years ago.Napolitano said. If they had to unmask Senator Pauls name to reveal a conversation he was having with a foreign agent and the foreign agent was hostile to the United States they can do that. Thats not what hes talking about. Theyre talking about unmasking him when hes having a conversation with his campaign manager when hes running in the Republican primary.He went on to say that Obama should be subpoenaed to testify, even though he would lie about it if he saw the unmasked intelligence.The Obama administration watching the Supreme Court means they had no qualms about watching everyone that didnt support every moronic step they made.Constantly selling this nation down the river to our enemies and Obama found it appropriate to watch everyone else because he was untrusting. He was untrusting because he was untrustworthy.Its now wondered that if Scalia was killed to keep things quiet. The autopsy wont be done now, and the late Justice deserves to rest in peace.Napolitano making that announcement is just another piece of damning evidence against Obama and his minions.Good job Obama.

The 3 Richest Democrats just gave Trump full support of his job as President. The three mega-billionaires were asked to give their opinions on President Trump as well as âtipsâ for him. Warren Buffet said, âI would certainly say to him [Trump] the same thing I would say to any other presidentâthat their most important job is to protect us from weapons of mass destruction and that they are the most important person in the world, to put the emphasis on that.â Charlie Munger then jumped in to add a very direct praise of the President, âI am a great admirer of the Trump change of mind about China and making an ally out of China instead of screaming about their trade.â Bill Gates decided to go a different route and offer the President his personal counsel. âWhether itâs research, making sure that pandemics donât come to get us and helping other countries â¦ Iâd make sure he knew all about it.â Itâs funny because Democrats LOVE pointing to these men as âgeniusesâ and using their quotes to back their point.

There, he said something that nobody was expecting. The Daily Caller reported that Obama admitted that he failed to achieve his goal of reversing economic disparity in his home city. He said that for âthree years,â he did his âbestâ to make this happen, but he ended up failing miserably. âI am the first to acknowledge that I did not set the world on fire, nor did I transform these communities in any significant way, although we did some good things,â he stated. âIt did change me,â Obama continued. âThis community gave me a lot more than I was able to give in return, because this community taught me that ordinary people, when working together, can do extraordinary things. This community taught me that everybody has a story to tell.

The more information you find out about Democratic IT scammer Imran Awan-the more you find out about the profile of a bold and careless criminal mind.Imran Awan was Debbie Wasserman Schultzs aide for thirteen years since she started working as a Florida representative in 2004. He was fired last week and continued to play her IT expert even when he was living in Pakistan.Accessing specific computer network without permission, also known as hacking, was the crime act that the three Pakistani brothers, who managed the IT affairs for several Democratic government officials, have committed.Imran Awan, who started working for Wasserman Schultz in 2005, received $164,600 in 2016, with close to $20,000 of that coming from Wasserman Schultz. His brother Jamal, who started working as a staffer in 2014, was paid $157,350.12 in 2016. Abid, who started working in 2005, was paid $160,943 in 2016. Imrans wife, Hina Alvi, who was employed as a staffer since February 2007, was paid 168,300 in 2016. Rao Abbas was paid $85,049 in 2016. Abid, Imran, and Jamal Awan were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives in February. Most of the House Members fired the Awans afterwards, while Imran Awan was still receiving payments from Debbie Wasserman Shultz until he was arrested for Bank Fraud after attempting to flee the country. The other members of the family left the country and moved to Pakistan together with hundreds of thousands of tax-payer money they mysteriously were able to wire. Democrats could be compromised by the Awans and Sensitive information revealed to foreign Enemies! (Muslim Brotherhood  Yemen Raid with dead soldier for example? Most of them have Seats on Committees that deal with highly sensitive information. According to Redditt  Imran Awan is now released with an GPS ankle monitor until his preliminary hearing on Aug. 21. Awan pretended to be his wife when issued a request for a loan from the Congressional Federal Credit Union and got it! He had the credit union wire $165,000 to PAKISTAN  no questions asked. Andrew McCarthy at National Review reported: Bank fraud was the stated charge on which Awan was arrested at Dulles Airport this week, just as he was trying to flee the United States for Pakistan, via Qatar. That is the same route taken by Awans wife, Hina Alvi, in March, when she suddenly fled the country, with three young daughters she yanked out of school, mega-luggage, and $12,400 in cash. By then, the proceeds of the fraudulent $165,000 loan theyd gotten from the Congressional Federal Credit Union had been sent ahead. It was part of a $283,000 transfer that Awan managed to wire from Capitol Hill. He pulled it off  hilariously, if infuriatingly  by pretending to be his wife in a phone call with the credit union. Told that his proffered reason for the transfer (funeral arrangements) wouldnt fly, Mrs. Awan promptly repurposed: Now she was buying property. Asking no more questions, the credit union wired the money . . . to Pakistan.Congressional-staff salaries are modest, in the $40,000 range. For some reason, Awan was paid about four times as much. He also managed to get his wife, Alvi, on the House payroll . . . then his brother, Abid Awan . . . then Abids wife, Natalia Sova. The youngest of the clan, Awans brother Jamal, came on board in 2014  the then-20-year-old commanding an annual salary of $160,000. A few of these arrangements appear to have been sinecures: While some Awans were rarely seen around the office, we now know they were engaged in extensive financial shenanigans away from the Capitol. Awan also threatened and tried to extort cash from his stepmother after his fathers death. The Daily Caller reported: Their own stepmother, a devout Muslim, called police in Virginia and said they used high-tech devices to wiretap her home and tried to extort her into signing papers that would give them access to cash stored in Pakistan in their deceased fathers name. The stepmother, Samina Gilani, said in court documents that Imran said he was very powerful and would have her loved ones kidnapped in Pakistan. Court records show that their father changed his last name, and two relatives said that was because he detested illegal behavior by his sons. In public lawsuits in Fairfax County, Va., the brothers have been accused of life insurance fraud as well as fraud involving a car dealership. This is a description of a complete slimeball. Who kicks his stepmother out of her home when she has just lost her husband? The more you read about Imran Awan the more you see the picture of a complete soulless criminal. So why was he hanging around Wasserman Schultz for 13 years? Now thisFederal officials are investigating whether sensitive information was passed from Imran Awan to the Russian or Pakistani governments.The New York Post reported: Federal authorities are investigating whether sensitive data was stolen from congressional offices by several Pakistani-American tech staffers and sold to Pakistani or Russian intelligence, knowledgeable sources say. What started out 16 months ago as a scandal involving the alleged theft of computer equipment from Congress has turned into a national-security investigation involving FBI surveillance of the suspects. Investigators now suspect that sensitive US government data  possibly including classified information  could have been compromised and may have been sold to hostile foreign governments that could use it to blackmail members of Congress or even put their lives at risk. This is a massive, massive scandal, a senior US official familiar with the widening probe told The Post.",1

And none were so eager as true American patriots.We just knew Trump would lay some massive truth bombs not the international community, and he didnât disappoint!At one point, Trump took direct aim at the socialism that is so anathema to true American democracy, but which had been championed by our previous president, Barack Hussein Obama.Addressing the crisis in Venezuela, Trump said:âI ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis.

We need to share and let all Americans know whatâs really going on.",1
63,Just In : President Trump Makes Major White House Change That Has Even Libs Speechless,https://conservativepost.com/just-in-president-trump-makes-major-white-house-change-that-has-even-libs-speechless/,"President Trump promised fiscal responsibility within government, using tax-payer monies wisely.And he is delivering on that promise.On Sunday, it was announced that the Trump administration is cutting itâs own budget by $22 million â in effect, Trump is leading the way by cutting funds to the White House, his current residence.The Democrat party and the mainstream media have been oddly quiet about this big changeâ¦Breitbart reports:The savings come from a cut in the amount spent on Michelle Obamaâs budget as First Lady, an end to the large number of âczarsâ and so-called âfellowshipsâ that Obama employed, and a smaller White House workforce, Forbes magazine reported.After the White House released its annual budget report last week, Adam Andrzejewski, president of government watchdog group OpenTheBooks.com, compared the newly reported budget to the last two years of the Obama administration.Andrzejewski (pronounced And-gee-eff-ski) noted that there are now 110 fewer White House employees since Obama left office, saving nearly $5 million alone. Also, the First Ladyâs staff has been cut from 24 staffers to only five. Michelle Obama entered the White House with a staff of 22 costing nearly $2 million annually, up from the $1.4 million spent during the George W. Bush era.Another area of savings was the elimination of the so-called policy âczarsâ with which Obama stocked the White House staff. The Trump budget shows not a single âczarâ employed for 2017.Trump also seems to have ended Obamaâs shady âfellowshipâ positions, people responsible for such special programs as Michelle Obamaâs âLet Girls Learnâ initiative and others. Some of these âfellowshipâ candidates in Obamaâs administration made up to $158,000 annually.",1
64,US Begs Russia For âMercyâ In Syria After Germany Opens American War Crime Investigation,http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2386.htm,"By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western SubscribersA new Ministry of Defense (MoD) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that after Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to yesterdayâs telephonic conference with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the Americanâs âbegged for mercyâ for their Islamic terrorist forces illegally operating in Syriaâbut that the MoD ignored by its continuing to obliterate these US-backed terror fighters with massive air power, with Syrian military forces, likewise, ignoring these US-backed militants by rushing pass them as they rapidly advanced across the Euphrates Riverâwhile at the same time, Germany has opened a criminal probe into the US illegally supplying these terrorists with weapons.

Click HERE.According to this report, during the emergency meeting held in Helsinki (Finland) requested by the US this past week, both Russia and America agreed that the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) should be implemented without exception as a âfirst bidâ to stop World War IIIâand with the Americanâs further agreeing that their terrorist forces operating in Syria would not enter the eastern city of Deir ez-Zorâthe battle for which the MoD had previously labeled as the âBattle For The Monasteryâ that they warned âwill decide the fate of the worldâ.Major General of the Syrian Republican Guard Issam Zahreddine (arms crossed), and his top female aide (cigarette in hand), talk with civilians in the eastern city of Deir ez-Zor on 10 September as they continue to press forward with Russian air cover in the offensive against ISIS and US-backed terrorists across the province.  [Note: Americans arenât allowed to know about the woman commanders in the Syrian Army fighting Islamic terrorists.]The United States âtotal capitulationâ on Syria, this report explains, is due to their fears over the shocking investigative findings made by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) released this past week detailing how the US has been illegally funneling billons-of-dollars of arms into this conflict zone causing the needless deaths of hundreds-of-thousands, and as they described:âThe Pentagon has relied on an army of contractors and sub-contractors â from blue-chip military giants to firms linked to organized crime â to supply up to US$ 2.2 billion worth of Soviet-style arms and ammunition to Syrian rebels fighting a sprawling war against the Islamic State (ISIS).Arms factories across the Balkans and Eastern Europe â already working at capacity to supply the Syrian war â are unable to meet the demand. In response, the US Department of Defense (DoD) has turned to new suppliers like Kazakhstan, Georgia, and Ukraine for additional munitions while relaxing standards on the material itâs willing to accept, according to an investigation by the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).âThe âSyrian rebelsâ supplied with these illegal US arms, this report explains, are mainly the al Qaeda linked Al-Nusra Front, and against whom, in 2014, the United Nations passed a resolution stating that all member states âshall prevent the direct or indirect supply sale or transfer to ISIL and Al-Nusra and associated individuals and groups, of arms and related materialsâ.Aside from grossly violating this UN resolution not arm these Islamic terror fighters, this report notes, the United States, also, violated German law by secretly transporting these illegal weapons through that European nation onto the battlefields of Syriaâand that the German prosecutorâs office in Kaiserslautern has now opened a criminal investigation into.Upon the OCCRP and BIRN releasing their shocking investigative findings detailing how the United States was committing a grave war crime by funneling these illegal weapons to radical Syrian Islamic terrorists, this report further notes, the US mainstream propaganda media immediately blocked this information from being known to the American peopleâbut after this stunning information went viral on the internet bypassing these propagandists, the CIA funded technology giant Google ordered its YouTube video service division to immediately erase every single Syrian War videoâas these videos proved where the weapons being used by Islamic terrorists came from and the horror they inflicted on innocent peoples.Acting as insane as ever too, this report continues, the true intentions of the United States towards Syria are not yet able to be deciphered by any normal mind eitherâas nearly immediately after the Americanâs âbegged for mercyâ for their Islamic terrorist forces facing annihilation in Syria, and agreed to keep them from entering Deir ez-Zor, both OCCRP and BIRN shockingly discovered that the Trump administration was budgeting another $600 million in illegal arms sales to these Islamic terrorists in order to keep this war ongoingâand with US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, also, continuing the âcritically flawedâ US policy that states âAmerica will not be satisfied as long as Syrian President Bashar Assad is in powerâ.Syrian President Assad himself, this report details, exposed this âcritical flawâ in US foreign policy in 2015 when he stated:âWestern propaganda has, from the very beginning, been about the cause of the problem being the president.Why? Because they want to portray the whole problem in Syria lies in one individual; and consequently the natural reaction for many people is that, if the problem lies in one individual, that individual should not be more important than the entire homeland.So let that individual go and things will be alright.Thatâs how they oversimplify things in the West.âFrom convincing the American people through the propaganda technique of âHitlerizationâ that everything would be âpeaches and brandyâ in Iraq if only Saddam Hussein was removed from power, and âwine and rosesâ would flourish in Libya once Muammar Gaddafi was gone, and everything in North Korea would be grand if only Kim Jong-un was deposed, and Venezuela would become a âparadise on Earthâ if only President Nicolas Maduro was overthrown, and Russia, too, would be âGods gift to the worldâ if only President Putin was killed, this report continues, this mental insanity employed by the United States against its own citizens to believe such childish things would be laughable, except that itâs caused hundreds-of-thousands of needless deaths, not to mention the tens-of-millions of lives shattered by this madness the world over.Put more bluntly, though, this report says, Chairwoman of the Federation Council Valentina Matviyenko warns that this âchildish and insaneâ American foreign policy of believing that only a single person in any nation controls its outcome is like âplaying with fireââand who further warned about these insane Americanâs by stating:âThey are using various means of political and economic pressure; they launch color revolutions and even direct military invasions.The rhetoric centered on âprotection of democracyâ can hardly fool anyone now.The reason behind such operations by the USA and their allies is their desire to maintain their dominant position in the world.  As far as the export of democracy is concerned, it only brings other peoples chaos, disasters and wars.No nation or group of nations can claim the title of carriers of the only authentic and model democracy that should be copied by the rest of the world.There canât be âpupil nationsâ and âtutor nationsâ, every state and every people has the right to its own choice of democracy model, without any outside interference.âChairwoman of the Federation Council Valentina MatviyenkoAnd in order to insure that the Syrian people have the right to their own government âwithout any outside interferenceâ, this report continues, Russian submarines two days ago fired a massive missile barrage that obliterated some of the last Islamic terrorist command-and-control centers in Syria that quickly caused over 1,000 US-backed Islamic terrorist to switch sides and join the Syrian Army, while at the same time, Iraqi forces launched a massive offensive to destroy ISIS terrorists on their side of the Syrian borderâthus allowing the Russian Reconciliation Centre in Syria to establish yet another ceasefire zone free from conflict.Because of Russia freeing Syria from the barbaric rule of these US-backed Islamic terrorists, this report details, over 600,000 Syrian people have been able to return to their homes under the rule of the supposed brutal dictator President Assadâand which the US mainstream propaganda media still refuses to tell the American people about because these truthful facts donât support their insane, and highly distorted, narrative that every leader in the world they donât like is a madman hated by his people and only worthy of death.Syrian girl-child celebrates President Assad and Russian liberation of Deir-ez-Zor, 10 September 2017And as always too, this report concludes, instead of the US mainstream propaganda media telling any truth to the American people about anything, they are, instead, using the same demonization tactics used against other world leaders they detest against their own President Donald Trumpâand as evidenced by their outrageously spending more media time bemoaning Trumpâs tweet about the ISIS terror attack in London yesterday than actually explaining why it happenedâand one of their main communistic spokesman Bill Maher, too, just hours ago, shockingly proclaiming that because none of Trumpâs properties were damaged by Hurricane Irma, it âproved that there is no Godâ.",1
65,Bombshell: New Evidence Suggest We Are Not Being Told Everything About Charlottesville,http://24wpn.com/index.php/2017/08/19/bombshell-new-evidence-suggests-we-are-not-being-told-everything-about-charlottesville/,"One unidentified officer in Charlottesville, VA has come forward and break his silence on the truth behind the events at Charlottesville, according to video via Headlines in Voice. He is suggesting that what took place in Charlottesville was not only allowed to happened, but was intentional and had been planned to happen since May. The officer said that the Charlottesville P.D were instructed to bring radical left and right groups together in one area before being told to stand down. Which suggests that it was someones intentions to start a violent race-based war at the protest. These are his words:The above video states the following, We [Charlotesville police] were ordered to bring the rival groups together. As soon as they were in contact with each other, we were told to stand down. It was outrageous. We werent allowed to arrest anyone without asking the mayor first. We werent even allowed to stop the driver as he sped away. The event was being set up as far back as at least May and it went like clockwork.Michael Signer, the mayor of Charlottesville, ordered police to stand down during the most chaotic and destructive period of the protests  despite police protests against the orders. We wanted to do our job and keep the peace. But these mother******s in charge really want to destroy America. Mayor Signer and other city officials appeared to have let this happen. Fox News reporter Doug McKelway was on the scene and had a similar account of the scene. I can say, having been in Emancipation Park from early on that morning, that what I saw with my own two eyes confirms what this law enforcement source told us. At least from all visible appearances. We saw people coming out of that park who had head wounds, who were bleeding from the head, people walking into that park with bats, with sticks  you saw what they were wearing  helmets, body armor, they had come  and this pertains to both sides  they had come to do damage.. you cannot help but notice from that video that police had been more pro-active, they could have potentially calmed this thing down to some degree. In This 38 second video, officers are seen simply observing Fields drive his battered car away from the destruction he caused. They make absolutely NO effort to stop the car that is maybe 2 yards away from them. As you can see, not a single bit of effort to stop the car. Very fishyLastly, [Mayor] Michael Signer is a Virginia Democratic activist who has close ties with Barrack Obama and John Podesta. We wont say what things look like, but we will let you develop an opinion for yourself",1
66,Perjury! 100% Proof Comey Lied to Congress,https://conservativepost.com/perjury-100-proof-comey-lied-to-congress/,"18 U.S. Code Â§ 1621 â Perjury generallyWhoeverâ1. having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true; or2. in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true;is guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. This section is applicable whether the statement or subscription is made within or without the United States.Elder Patriot â CNNâs admission today that President-elect Donald Trump had indeed been wiretapped raises a serious question as to just who is in the business of spreading conspiracy theories.It also suggests that Former F.B.I. Director James Comey deliberately perjured himself when he appeared before a House subcommittee and denied any knowledge that Donald Trump â first as a candidate and then as the president â had been wiretapped.When President Trump tweeted that he had been wiretapped while in Trump Tower the media tried painting him as a conspiracy nut.CNN pounced on Trump for starting a conspiracy theory and that the wiretapping claim was an âincendiary idea.â  CNN was only the tip of the spear.  MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The L.A. Times, the entirety of the Deep State controlled mainstream media all joined in discrediting the newly elected president.A full 42 days before Trumpâs tweet, the NY Times was the first to report that he had been wiretapped.  That was before it was decided that it would be best to deny it ever happened because they found nothing incriminating.That may not be illegal for a newspaper, especially a rag like the Times, but it is for any member of our intelligence community.The fact that the wiretaps turned up nada meant that Obama had convinced the FISA court to give the NSA and the FBI a fishing license for political purposes.  That is the way the Soviet Union operated against their political enemies.In the United States our government is prevented from opening investigations without just cause.  At least we thought so.  Foolish us.  After the IRS scandal why would we trust the Obama administration to play it straight on anything else?  Shame on us.Essentially the mainstream media chose to twist the emerging facts into knots once it became obvious that James Comey was lying to protect his illegal use of FISA court warrants under orders from President Obama.From March 5th through March 21st we laid out the case in thirteen columns that Trump had been wiretapped for political reasons, Obama knew about it, and that Trump had trapped Comey into perjuring himself.For our efforts we were castigated and the social media giants crushed the reach of our articles.  Weâve come to recognize that weâre on to something big whenever the social media platforms begin limiting the number of people who get to view our work.Today our investigative work was vindicated.  The mainstream media, led by CNN, was forced to admit that the U.S. government, under President Barack Obama, had wiretapped Donald Trumpâs former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, including his conversations with President Trump â both during after the 2016 presidential campaign.That leaves Comey facing a perjury charge for lying, under oath, that Trump had never been wiretapped.There is simply no possibility that Comey, as director of the F.B.I. wasnât aware that Trump Tower had been wiretapped.  If that had happened without Comeyâs knowledge it was his job to bring the violators to justice.Not so shockingly, Comeyâs obfuscation wasnât isolated.  Another Deep State operative standing in direct opposition to Trump, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also denied any knowledge of the wiretapping.If that is the case then who in the hell went before the FISA court, got the authorization from another of Obamaâs crooked judges, and then executed the taps?Question: Why isnât anyone in any of the 17 intelligence agencies asking this question?Answer: Because the government long ago stopped answering to We the People.",1
67,Trump Wins Dangerous âPakistan Gambitâ That Spells âTotal Doomâ For US Democratic Party,http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2384.htm,"An intriguing Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today reveals that President Donald Trump has pulled off one the most dangerous âgambit dealsâ [an action entailing a degree of risk calculated to gain an advantage] ever attempted in modern American political history when he pitted a $225 million military aid package to Pakistan against that nationâs Inter-Services Intelligence (IS) spy agency to pressure them into agreeing to immediately surrender a Pakistani woman to US authoritiesâand whose testimony could very well spell the âtotal doomâ of the entire American Democratic Party.  [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]According to this report, President Trumpâs âgambit dealâ with Pakistan began on 6 April 2017 when the United States Capitol Police (USCP) filed a mysterious report that stated:âOn 4/6/2017 at 0021 hours, with the building closed to the public, AOC informed USCP Rayburn offices of an unattended bag in the phone booth on the 2nd floor. The officer received the open-contents visible bag and prepared a found property report. While reviewing the inventory of the bag contents, the officer found#1 a Pakistani ID card with the name Mohommed Ashraf Awan#2 a copy â not original â of a drivers license with name Imran Awan#3 a copy (front and back) of his congressional ID#4 an Apple laptop with the homescreen initials âRepDWSâ (Representative Debbie Wasserman-Shultz)#5 composition notebooks with notes handwritten saying âattorney client privilegeâ and possibly discussing case details below#6 loose letters addressed to US Attorney of DC discussing the apparent owner of the bag being investigated.Approximately 3-4 months ago officer was requested by SAA as police presence of 4 individuals being interviewed, including the bag owner. It is unknown to the officer whether he is still employed.âMohommed Ashraf Awan, this report explains, had previously been identified by the SVR as being a âdeep coverâ Pakistani IS operative who had embedded himself within the Democratic Party establishment working under his Americanized name of Imran Awanâand who was the top computer information technology specialist for disgraced former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman, and US Congresswoman, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.Labeled previously by the SVR as a âradical Islamic spy masterâ, this report details, Imran Awan first infiltrated the US Congress in January 2004 when he became the âinformation technology directorâ for Democratic Party US Congressman Robert Wexlerâand who, also, over these past nearly 13 years, infiltrated into the US Congress his wife, Hina Alvi, and his brothers Abid and Jamalâwith Jamal, at just 20 years old, being given by the Democratic Party in the US Congress the outlandish yearly salary of $160,000.The Imran Awan spy ring operating within the US Capitol under the protection of the Democratic Party, this report continues, began to unravel this past February (2017) when they were linked to the death of Navy SEAL William Ryan Owens whose secret raid details were leakedâand whom President Trump quickly retaliated against.With President Trumpâs forces closing in on them, this report notes, Imran Awanâs wife Hina Alvi, on 5 March, was able to flee the United States with other members of her familyâwhile Imran Awan stayed behind to liquidate their families vast real estate holdings made possible by the $9 million paid to them by the Democratic Party and US Congressâbut who himself was successfully captured by US federal forces on 24 July when he had attempted to flee tooâbut who was arrested because he pretended to be his wife when requesting a loan from the US Congressional Federal Credit Unionâgot the loan, and then had this credit union wire $165,000 to Pakistanâwith no no questions asked.Even after his wife Hina Alvi had fled to Pakistan, this report continues, Congresswoman Wasserman-Shultz continued paying Imran Awan up the very day of his arrestâand that she fully intended on continuing to pay him should he have successfully been able to flee.As to why Congressman Wasserman-Shultz and her Democratic Party continued to pay Imran Awan, this report explains, was due to their fears of what he knewâand that was everything as he had installed a secret server to capture every single US Congress document produced, including intelligence filesâand as astonishingly described the Washington D.C. based Daily Caller News Service:âNow-indicted former congressional IT aide Imran Awan allegedly routed data from numerous House Democrats to a secret server. Police grew suspicious and requested a copy of the server early this year, but they were provided with an elaborate falsified image designed to hide the massive violations.The falsified image is what ultimately triggered their ban from the House network Feb. 2, according to a senior House official with direct knowledge of the investigation.The secret server was connected to the House Democratic Caucus, an organization chaired by then-Rep. Xavier Becerra. Police informed Becerra that the server was the subject of an investigation and requested a copy of it. Authorities considered the false image they received to be interference in a criminal investigation, the senior official said.Data was also backed up to Dropbox in huge quantities, the official said. Congressional offices are prohibited from using Dropbox, so an unofficial account was used, meaning Awan could have still had access to the data even though he was banned from the congressional network.âImportant to about Imran Awan, too, this report says, are that his actions on 6 April when he left for the US Capitol Police to find Congressman Wasserman-Schultzâs laptop Apple computer, confidential attorney notes, and letters to the US Attorney (that were found on the second floor of the Rayburn building â a place Awan would have had no reason to go because Wasserman Schultz's office is in the Longworth building) shows he is in great fear tooâand as US Congressman Louie Gohmert confirmed with his recently stating: âIf Awan thought he was better off with his crimes documented, that suggests he feared something worse than prison, that this was a matter of life insurance.âAs to what and/or whom Imran Awan would fear more than prison, this report details, is, most certainly, the Clinton Crime Family and their infamous âClinton Death Listââand who immediately after Awanâs arrest, dispatched one of their top âinner-circleâ attorneys named Chris Gowan to defend himâwith no one bothering to explain (or the US mainstream press investigating) how a defendant who just told a US Federal Judge that he could not afford an attorney because he was âmillions of dollars in debtâ, could, 15 minutes later, have one of the most expensive lawyers in America defending him.Congresswoman Wasserman-Shultz, also, this report continues, employed another high-power Clinton Crime Family attorney named William Pittard, to argue that her Apple laptop computer obtained by the US Capitol Police from Imran Awan as his âlife insurance policyâ should not be examinedâbut who wasnât successful in this childish effort, with Imran Awan even now having for himself a complete copy of this computers hard drive given to him by US Attorneys under that nations âdiscovery lawsâ.In his knowing that this scandal could very well destroy the Democratic Party forever, this report notes, President Trump, also, knew that in order for US federal prosecutors to discover how âwide and deepâ the Imran Awan spy ring had penetrated the government, and what other secrets they possessed, âhinged/pivotedâ on their securing the testimony of Awanâs wife Hina Alviâbut whom, in late August, Pakistan refused to extradite to the United States.Immediately following Pakistanâs refusal to hand over Hina Alvi, this report continues, President Trump, on 30 August, employed his âgambitâ by his notifying the US Congress that he was putting $255 million in military assistance to Pakistan on holdâwhile at the same time offering to both Imran Awan and his wife Hina Alvi what some are now describing as a âsignificant immunity dealâ.Though Pakistan initially slammed President Trump for being âhostile and threateningâ towards them, this report says, their powerful Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency, nevertheless, agreed to expedite Hina Alviâs travel to America later this monthâunder the condition that she not be arrested or handcuffed in front of her childrenâbut who will have to turn-in her passport when she returns to the United States, with her further agreeing not seek or book any international travel following her appearance in the United States Federal Court.In order to ensure that Inter-Services Intelligence keeps their side of this agreement to return Hina Alvi to the United States by the end of this month, this report notes, President Trump had his US State Department, yesterday, place Pakistan in a category that lists them as not being fiscally transparent in how they spend American money on their spy agenciesâbut that after Hina Alvi reaches the US, will be rescinded, thus allowing Pakistan to receive their $225 million in military assistance currently being blocked.With the US mainstream propaganda media still blacklisting the information of the, most likely, greatest scandal in US history from being widely known to the America people, and who never report on any scandals involving the Democratic Party, this report continues, their being able to ignore this any longer is coming to a quick endâand when compared to the âfake newsâ Russian scandal, is not only real, but growing in its ferocity too.This report concludes with SVR intelligence analysts predicting that President Trump will âweaponizeâ this scandal in order to totally destroy the Democratic Partyâwith Trump expected to drag it out for months to its climax during the 2018 US midterm elections that the Democratic Party has only managed to raise $21 million in donations from small donors for, and whose former DNC Chairman, Howard Dean, stunningly just admitted about Americaâs young voters âthese people are not Democratsââand whose nominal leader, Hillary Clinton, has just released a new book showing that she still doesnât know why she lost to President Trumpâbut that any Russian school-child knowing simple mathematics could explain by their showing Clinton the fact that Trump won 2,622 counties in America, while she only won 490âand that no matter how much the Democratic Party and their mainstream media sycophant elites donât like to face it, there are simply not enough coastal seats to be won for Democrats to ever win the US Congress again.",1
68,Russia Declares âState Of War Now Existsâ: Orders âMasterchainâ Destruction Of America,http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2351.htm,"An apocalyptic sounding new report released in the Kremlin today by the Security Council (SC) affirms that a âstate of warâ now exists between the Federation and the United Statesâwith all members, including President Putin, authorizing a âMasterchainâ counter attack against the Americans that, if fully successful, could see that nations entire economy destroyed by the end of October.  [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]According to this report (and as we warned about in our 23 July article New US Law To Remove Trump From Power And Declare War On Russia âWill Be Met By Forceâ), President Donald Trump, yesterday, was unable to withstand the âDeep Stateâ forces arrayed against him, thus causing him to sign a new sanctions regime against Russia that specifically targets all of Russiaâs major industries for destructionâand that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev quickly responded to by grimly stating:âThe signing of new sanctions against Russia into law by the US president leads to several consequences. First, any hope of improving our relations with the new US administration is over. Second, the US just declared a full-scale trade war on Russia. Third, the Trump administration demonstrated it is utterly powerless, and in the most humiliating manner transferred executive powers to Congress.This shifts the alignment of forces in US political circles.What does this mean for the U.S.? The American establishment completely outplayed Trump. The president is not happy with the new sanctions, but he could not avoid signing the new law.The purpose of the new sanctions was to put Trump in his place. Their ultimate goal is to remove Trump from power. An incompetent player must be eliminated.At the same time, the interests of American businesses were almost ignored. Politics rose above the pragmatic approach. Anti-Russian hysteria has turned into a key part of not only foreign (as has been the case many times), but also domestic US policy (this is recent).The sanctions codified into law will now last for decades, unless some miracle occurs.â. With the American âDeep Stateâ now firmly in control of the United States, this report continues, President Putinâs orders, issued in late 2016, to âprepare for warâ against the United States have now been acceleratedâand none more fearful than âOperation Masterchainâ.Though the propaganda Western media focused exclusively on President Putinâs bomb shelter preparations, this report details, they failed to inform their peoples that Russia has the most extensive network of bomb shelters to protect against nuclear war the world has ever knownâwhile the United States has no protection for its citizens as it doesnât even spend any money on them.In October 2016 when President Putin ordered these preparations for war, this report says, the Western propaganda media, also, failed to report to their peoples that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation had developed a âMasterchainâ prototype and successfully made its first test transactionsâand that is one of the most fearsome weapons of global economic warfare ever invented.Managed by FinTech under the governance of the Central Bank of Russia, this report explains, the Federation has become the first nation in the world to digitalize its entire domestic and international economy under the âblockchainâ distributed database system (the most important invention since the Internet itself)âand that Tunisia became, in January 2016, the first nation in the world to convert its currency into.Though many in the world know about crypto currencies (such as Bitcoin and Tunisiaâs eDinar), this report details, very few understand the staggering implications of its underlying âblockchainâ infrastructureâthat is the most secure method of transferring wealth (of all kinds) ever invented, is impervious to hacking and/or spying, and by the day is revolutionizing our entire planet.With the United States placing its entire economic future under the full control of a vast global military structure, that requires continual conquest of other nations, and has wasted trillions-of-dollars of that nations wealth, this report continues, Russia, instead, invested its economic future in the âBlockchain Revolutionââthat is called âMasterchainâ and whose crypto currency has been named âGasâ.Once fully operational, this report notes, âMasterchainâ and âGasâ will provide to the world the most secure and secret method of transferring wealth history has ever knownâand will be impervious to sanctions, spying and all Western interference.As nearly all Western economists are warning that the American stock markets are heading for an October 2017 crash of epic proportions, this report says, President Putin has today ordered both âMasterchainâ and âGasâ to âimmediately prepareâ for this global economic crisis offering âsafety and securityâ to everyone seeking to protect their wealth and investments.And with trillions-of-dollars flowing into âMasterchainâ and âGasâ, this report explains, the United States will be unable to find any global liquidity to sustain itselfâas it is already being crushed by its massive $19.9 trillion debtâthat when distributed among its 326.7 million citizens, sees each of them owing their government a staggering $60,192 for each and every one of them.Russia, however, this report continues, has never matched the warmongers in America and has kept defense spending at a fraction of what the US spendsâthus allowing the Federation to have a miniscule national debt of only $157.9 billionâthat can be paid off instantly from Russiaâs $412 billion of savingsâand whose 143 million citizens owe nothingâand all of whom live in a nation twice the size of the United States having a total national wealth of $75 trillion.With the âDeep Stateâ now firmly in control of the US Congress, this report warns, their bloodlust shows no signs of abating either as they are now, also, preparing several defense bills that would require their Department of Defense to violate the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty with Russia through the development of medium-range missiles banned under the accordâwith one of their top Democratic Party lawmakers, US Senator Ben Cardin, triumphantly declaring âWe make the laws, not the President of the United Statesâ.And as President Trump just hours ago warned that relations between the US and Russia are at an all-time and very dangerous low, and his adding that the American people should blame the US Congress for this turn of events, this report concludes, his sudden announcement that he is going into seclusion for 17 days (beginning Friday) has raised further alarms among Security Council members wondering who exactly is now in control of the United States.",1

The tobacco company has been setting up a distribution process across North and South American territories, to streamline the supply lines.Since only tobacco products are currently banned in advertisements and promotions in the United States, the company also has set aside an enormous $7 billion advertising budget to market the new âNewport Nirvanaâ brand and are now negotiating with major networks and publishers, to begin marketing the product to consumers in the second half of 2017.The company has also begin to advertise the new brand in magazines and on billboards which can be seen in Colorado and Washington.Harrison also revealed that the company has planned around January next year, to begin airing commercials with celebrity endorsements including Snoop Dogg, Seth Rogan and Bill Maher. However, since marijuana is legal only in Colorado and Washington, the advertisements will only be aired in Colorado and Washington.",1

According to police statements, Jessop was sorting through the stores discount DVD bin when she discovered a lifeless newborn buried in the middle of the bin. On-scene witnesses say that several customers made it over to the area after hearing Jessop scream and call for help. Jessop recalled seeing a small foot as she dug to the bottom of the DVD pile. Initially she assumed that someone had placed a doll within the pile. It wasnât until she grabbed the foot and pulled the body from the pile of DVDs that she realized it was not a doll, but the body of a lifeless newborn girl.Local police and paramedics confirmed that the child had been dead for approximately 48 hours and was estimated to be around two months old. Upon reviewing security footage, police estimated that the child was placed in the DVD bin by the young girls mother on Friday. The security footage provided by Walmart Loss Prevention Department has yet to be released to the public. However, investigating officers believe the newbornâs mother to be Luciana Garcia, a 27-year-old Roy County resident.According to investigating officers, the security footage does not show Garcia placing the lifeless newborn in the DVD bin, however it does show the 27-year-old woman âlingering aroundâ the DVD bin while wearing a dark green backpack and âbehaving in a suspicious manner.âJessop told local reporters that Walmart management provided her with a $50 gift card to make up for her troubling experience. However, she said it will be some time before sheâs ready to shop at that Walmart store again.",1

Some people just cant get over the fact that he beat Hillary Clinton. It seems like these people are forgetting that Clinton never had a chance to get any near the Oval Office. Now liberals have been too vocal about their criticism for the President, and its all about the covfefe word that appeared in one of the latest tweets. Liberals will always have a reason to bash President Trump. First, they hated his campaign, then, they laid their hands on the Presidents family. We know that President Trump will always be our favorite, and hopefully, liberals will understand that they cant do anything to change this.Although President Trump faced harsh criticism, he still stands strong against his enemies. He promised to make America great again, and we can already see the results of his job.President Trump came back from his first official tour overseas. This trip was an absolute success, and the President did an amazing job. World leaders appreciated his presence, and they all honored the President. He enjoyed great respect, and came back with a few important deals. But, President Trump came back with something else. Its the covfefe mystery. For those who dont know it, covfefe means I will stand up. Liberals thought that President Trump was dream texting, but they are too ignorant to understand the meaning of his tweet. Despite the constant negative press covfefe, President Trump tweeted. He was just trying to say that hed stand strong for the upcoming events, promising that he will manage to protect the country from everything and everyone. Learn this, liberals.",1

The label itself says that the drug has a âhigh potential for abuse and dependence,â which is not something most parents want their children to be consuming daily.Active ingredients in the drug itself make it addicting, but the sweet, candy-flavored gummies only serve to keep kids wanting more. Many healthcare professionals are concerned about possible addiction-forming that could follow the children into adulthood, but that hasnât stopped Neos Therapeutics from producing the drug.The Dallas-based pharmaceutical company is pushing forward with Adzenys XR-ODT, the name give to this new form of meth. The CEO of the company, Vipin Garg, âlaunching now at full speedââpun intendedâin an effort to get âahead of back-to-school season.âNeos Therapeutics has shown no shame in this new endeavor, and, instead, has bragged about their 125 sales representatives who have been making appointments with physicians to get the drug out on the market.While lawmakers are attempting to ban cannabis edibles that resemble sweet treats, the government is continuing to push these addicting gummy drugs because it can actually be controlled and turn out a profit.Though lawmakers are ignoring the emergence of this dangerous substance, citizens cannot ignore the concerning fact that recreational use of medications like Adderall have increased in adults by 67 percent. To top it all off, the side effects of these drugs range from mild to sudden death, which has apparently happened in adults. Dr. Carl Hart, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Columbia University, said:âThe public remains almost entirely ignorant of the fact that methamphetamine produces nearly identical effects to those produced by the popular ADHD medication d-amphetamine (dextroamphetamine). You probably know it as Adderall.âOther side effects include fever, hair loss, hallucinations, psychotic episodes, strokes, and dangerously high blood pressure, meaning that there are no benefits for children in taking this drug over Adderall, which may have the same active ingredients but at least it doesnât taste like candy.Despite the evidence that these drugs can kill and are being offered to children, the FDA has said that they are safe and effective in treating ADHD and narcolepsy.",1

It was alleged that on three different dates in one month two doctors died on the very same day, which means six doctors in total who died in pairs over three different days.Many skeptics rolled their eyes at the first few deaths believing it to be no more than coincidence that they had all been doctors.There were many deaths that were unsolved murders, more were alleged to be suicides and many of the deaths are under investigation.The majority of the doctors had been holistic and all them were said to have cared very passionately and deeply about health.",1

Wikileaks named Paul Ryan, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain as Republicans who were paid off by Clinton to ensure that Donald Trump lost the election, or undermine him if he won as reported by Conservative Daily Post. Her evil plot was revealed in an email sent last July from Clintons campaign manager John Podesta to top aide Huma Abedin.Podesta detailed how the funds were being redirected from Clintons campaign to the Super PACs of Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, and Jeb Bush.JB, CF, and JK PACS will be noticeably silent for the rest of the campaign. The email continued, Each will receive a significant allowance from advertising budget. HRC is in the loop and has talked to all three personally. Eyes only. As revealed in other emails, several members of the Republican Party were bought off in order to push the Clinton agenda forward. Only one day before Speaker of the House Paul Ryan retracted Donald Trumps invitation to speak at an event in Wisconsin, an email was sent out that could be to blame. It read, He is on board, will retract the invitation to speak. Eyes only. Other Clinton emails imply that money is being moved to Republican elected officials in the House and Senate.

During his hour-long speech, a smiling Pope Francis was quoted telling the White House guests that the Koran, and the spiritual teachings contained therein, are just as valid as the Holy Bible, and should therefore be respected as such.âJesus Christ, Jehovah, Allah. These are all names employed to describe an entity that is distinctly the same across the world. For centuries, blood has been needlessly shed because of the desire to segregate our faiths.

This is said to be in protest to a government that does not respect their religious rights, and a minority that has encroached on one of their time honored traditions.Since the historic day in which gay couples could wed nation wide, thousands of Christian couples are filing for divorce.Mary Lambert and her husband Jay were among the first to arrive at the courthouse in Topeka Kansas to file for divorce. Despite having been married for over 14 years, they chose to call it quits to avoid affiliation with a government that no longer respects their values. âI love my husband very much, but above all, I love my god, Jesus Christ. This is why we are moving forward in defiance of the Supreme Court ruling. If our government chooses to celebrate sin and spit on one of the most righteous ceremonies within our faith, then they are on their own. Marriage is about so much more than love. A family cannot grow together if they have no relationship with Christ. Anything else is just a sad parody. Itâs unfortunate that even our president has made the choice to stoop so low and pander to Satanâs agendaAdam Cyrus is the founder of Christ in Family Services which provides bible-based counseling to married Christian couples throughout Topeka Kansas. Cyrus says he supports the wave of high-principled duos seeking divorce as an act of protest. âWe are symbolically divorcing a government which no longer honors our culture and values.

86,The Clinton Body Count Continues...New Evidences Revealed,http://americannews.com/24759-2/,"Most Conservatives know that the Clintons pose a real threat to America and their body count continues to rise. They have killed more people than the Swine Flu and Ebola combined. Of course everybody wants to ask the obvious question about Hillary Clintons IT guy, Why would a server guy plead the 5th?! One answer, he did it to save his life. This man is a liability because he may know more than anyone about the killings.Sorcha Faal believes that its best to err on the side of caution, but not doing so will put you in the dog pound with the Mafia, otherwise known as the Clinton Foundation:In what a new Foreign Intelligence Service(SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today calls a ""master incestuous maneuver"", the Bush Crime Family has rushed to the side of Hillary Clinton afrter a top United Nations official set to testify her in a US District Court yesterday was found dead by FBI agents who were set to deliver him before a Grand Jury. (Note: some words and phrases appearing in this report are English language approximations of Russian words and phrases having no exact counterpart.) According to this report, former UN Presiden John Ashe was scheduled to terstify against Hillary Clinton yesterday in a New York City US District Court, but when FBI agents arrived at his Dobbs Ferry, New York, mansion he was found dead of what current UN President Mogens Lykketoft said was a heart attack-but that SVR intelligence analysts say in this report is impossible to determine prior to an autopsy being performed and medical tests conducted. This is reminiscent of the time that Ron Brown went on an assignment for the Clintons and his plane just so happened to crash into a mountain.CNN reported at the time that Browns hand was forced:A former business partner of the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown testified in U.S. District Court Monday that Brown had told her President and Mrs. Clinton supported at White House plan to sell seats on international trade missions to raise campaign contributions. Nolanda Hill, who is under federal indictment for fraudulent business practices, claimed Brown was angered when White House political operatives forced him to provide seats on trade missions as a fund-raising device.The Clintons will do anything for money. Dont forget they sold secrets to the Chinese for campaign contributions. This Chinese billionaire has avoided the Clintons death wish so far. Faal continues:Along with UN President Ashe and Chinese billionaire Seng being indicted for being a part of this massive bribery scheme to enrich the Clinton's and fuel Hillary's presidential run, this report notes, Francis Lorenzo, the ambassador to the UN for the Dominican Republic, and the top two executives for the Global Sustainability Foundation(GSF), Sheri Yan and Heidi Hon Piao, were, also, changed, all of whom had reached plea deals in exchange for their testimony against the Clinton's and Seng-has had, likewise, UN President Ashe done just prior to his death. Grimly to note too, this report continues, is that a ""powerful indicator"" that UN President Ashe was being targeted for death revealed itself this past January(2016) when Chinese billionare Seng (currently under house arrest in his New York City penthouse) suddenly dropped his bid for a speedy trial-and which SVR analysts in this reoprt attribute to his being given ""assurances/guarantees"" by the Clinton's that once Hillary gained the US presidency he would pardoned. Make no mistake, Hillary enjoys the killings. The Clintons are dangerous and they will sell America down the river with no remorse.",1

The Clinton family, including extended relatives and members of the Rodham clan, have been filinginto Little Rock all week where Bill is reportedly bedridden at the residence attached to his presidential library.From an article in The Political Insider, authors Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince share the big reveal:In their new book, Bill & Hillary: So This is That Thing Called Love, the authors interview Clinton insiders who claim thatBill slept with so many women that Hillary Clinton has repeatedly forced him to get an HIV test from the doctor. This is becausethe former President âfavored unprotected sex.âAnd while the first tests came back negative, HIV and AIDS might explain an ongoing mystery. Over the years, both Clintons havekept their medical records a secret. Clinton has explained his rapidly changing appearance to his heart surgery and ânew dietâbut he has looked increasingly thin and weak at Hillary campaign rallies.Being someone who has had first hand experience watching a family member die from AIDS, this writer can testify that Bill Clintonlooks like he is very close to entering the final stages and is holding on for dear life! Hillary appears to be keeping thefamily physician close at hand even if for no other reason than the old grim reaper may be stalking her too!The fact that theyâre booking rooms and sticking around most likely means theyâre expecting to have to stay for a funeral. TheClintons have said that they would refuse any state burial or national ceremony if anything were to happen to them during theTrump administration as they are afraid of what he may say during the service. According to a Clinton spokesman:âDonald Trump is mean and vindictive. If something were to happen to one of the Clintons, he could demand to speak at a nationalservice and who knows what kind of disrespect would come out of his childish mouth.âIf the rumors are true, a service would be held at the Arkansas State House after Clinton spends two days lying in state in thearboretum at his library. The Trump family would not be invited.This is a developing story that will be updated.",1

Conservatives recognized that America was at risk if Democrats kept the power.Recently, the full panel of 9 justices came together for the first time to decide the fate of Islam being taught within our public school system. The decision shows just how close we came to disaster. The 5-4 ruling ultimately decided that Sharia Law or any ideology that contradicts basic human rights will not be taught in Americas public schools. This shows just how important the election of President Trump was and his decision to appoint Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.The government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isnt a government issue or a religious issue, Gorsuch said in a statement. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion. We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judaeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldnt be filling the children with lies about Islam being a religion of peace when they see the carnage on the news almost every day. Gorsuch cast the tie-breaking vote that decided that only the true historical account of Islamic history would be taught in the classroom.",1

94,Donald Trump Signs Executive Order Allowing The Hunting Of Bald Eagles,https://archive.is/2yRCq#selection-3293.0-3293.70,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) â Today President Donald Trump made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency by signing Executive Order 14841, which allows the hunting of bald eagles.Speaking at a White House Press Conference today, Trump explained his decision for making the hunting of the bald eagle legal.âThereâs nothing more American and more of a symbol of freedom, than having the freedom to hunt and kill a bald eagle,â Trump told reporters. âThis will allow Americans to take advantage of their Second Amendment rights in the most Patriotic way possible. Plus the taste is absolutely tremendous, a great bird, the best tasting bird. I ate one the last time I was in China, absolutely delicious.âThe bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States of America. The bald eagle appears on its seal. The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic, in which eagle imagery (usually involving the golden eagle) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted the design for the Great Seal of the United States depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 arrows and an olive branch with its talons. The bald eagle appears on most official seals of the U.S. government, including the presidential seal, the presidential flag, and in the logos of many U.S. federal agencies. In 1940 a Federal law was passed that provides protection of the bald eagle by prohibiting the take, possession, sale, purchase, barter, offer to sell, purchase or barter, transport, export or import, of any bald eagle, alive or dead, including any part, nest or egg. Trumpâs Executive Order will override this law, legalizing the hunting and killing of the bird, allowing the hunter to do with the bald eagle as he or she sees fit.Trump spoke further to reporters about his decision to allow the hunting of bald eagles.âHonestly, I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country. He is a bird of bad moral character, very bad. He does not get his living honestlyâ¦ probably is an illegal too. And because of this we should change the symbol of America, the American Seal, to something more appropriate, something greater, and I can only think of one thing; Trump Towers. They stand for freedom in this country and the potential that every good Christian, God-fearing American has in this country.âThis Executive Order does not come as a surprise to most environmental activists. 38-year-old Paul Horner, with the Washington State Department of Ecology, says he disagrees with everything Trump has done since taking office when it comes to protecting the environment.âTrump put a man in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) who doesnât believe in climate change. Heâs lifting regulations on every evil out there imaginable; allowing coal dumping in our waters, attempting to rid us of every law that protects the environment, laws which have been put in place over the last hundred years to keep us alive so greed like this canât happen,â Horner said âTrump is doing everything possible to get rich off this, to polluting the air we breathe to putting GMOâs in all the food that we eat,â Horner said. âItâs only a matter of time before Trump Towers is under water and weâre all wearing oxygen masks, something that heâll profit off of through insurance and heâll probably make the oxygen masks called âTrump Fun Masksâ or something. Itâs absolutely disgusting and the public needs to wake up to what this greedy as*hole is doing to our environment and the planet Earth.âTrump quickly took to Twitter to respond to those who oppose of his Executive Order that allows the hunting of bald eagles.âThere is NOTHING more PATRIOTIC than killing a bald eagle, the symbol of AMERICA! Executive Order 14841 will be GREAT, THE BEST THING EVER!âOnce a common sight in much of the continent, the bald eagle was severely affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the birdâs calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. The species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty, later extended to all of North America. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the golden eagle, prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators.Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters details of the bald eagle hunting licenses that will be made available to the public on June 1st, 2017.âThese hunting licenses for the bald eagle will be made available to only those Americans who truly love this country. They must be able to prove that that they are American, and not illegal anchor babies or Muslims. Also, these licenses are free for children under the age of twelve. If youâre not a good, Christian American, donât even think of getting one of these licenses. These licenses stand for freedom and are not to be abused or used by those who hate America.âThe Trump administration said it has plans to completely defund the EPA by the end of the year, which has already devastated the great barrier reef, saying that this will allow more funds available for defense.Tom Downey, political activist, told reporters he believes what Trump is doing is wrong, but can be stopped.âFrom citizens swarming airports and launching legal challenges to block Trumpâs travel ban, to the flooding of town halls, offices and voicemails of Congress across the country to defeat the disastrous roll back of our healthcare rights, on many fronts right now massive citizen mobilization is winning! The Trump Administration calls Climate Change a hoax and a waste! But when we show up together we have tremendous power, letâs never forget it!âSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to reporters about Trumpâs decision to legalize the hunting of bald eagles in this country.âEverything Trump stands for is backwards. His appointment of racist Steve Bannon, the way he unites hate for the Muslim people in this country, his support of white power organizations. He appointed a cabinet full of billionaires and millionaires to standup for the lower and middle class. The person he puts in charge of the EPA denies climate change. The person he put in charge of education doesnât believe in public education. The American people should not accept this and Saturday Night Live makes fun of him the best way they know how. The children of this country deserve a leader who will build a successful future for them and can take a joke and not attempt to stop freedom of speech.â Bradley said. âAlso, I just want to say a big thanks to everyone that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.âFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told CNN that he believes what Trump is doing is the right thing.âThis is a great first step in the war against masturbation in this great Christian nation of ours! The bald eagle is an extremely sexy looking bird and only brings out deviant behavior in the Atheists, Devil Worshippers, non-normals and the heathens of this country. Way to go Donald Trump, you are legendary! Praise!âThe Trump Administration has setup a hotline for those wishing to voice any concerns or comments over the new bald eagle hunting licenses that will be made available next month. That hotlineâs phone number is (785) 273-0329.",1

This is something that has been missing from the White House for some time now. Recently, Hannity gave a report about Trump that speaks louder than any of his statements could. During the war, Trump reportedly helped 200 stranded Marines who didnt have a flight home to Florida. Cpl. Ryan Stickney claims that after his unit spent six months in Saudi Arabia, it went to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina before heading home to Miami. Due to a logistics failure, the troops ended up stranded. The way the story was told to us was that Mr. Trump found out about it and sent the airline down to take care of us, Stickney commented. And thats all we knewI remember asking Who is Donald Trump? I truly didnt know anything about him. This is the same person that the media likes to portray as selfish. It may not seem like much to most people, but it was very important to a bunch of jar heads and more importantly their families waiting for them on the hot tarmac, he continued. I have not seen a Clinton or Sanders plane, or anything else for that matter, sent to support the troops. What do you think of Trump?

No one flies more than me. Listen, I own a jet. I own a 757, beautiful plane, itâs the best plane! If the world were round, believe me, I would know!âThe comments came in response to a question from AP reporter, Charles Darr, regarding the future role of the National Guard, as private companies proliferate space travel. âMr. Trump, if elected, are you willing to increase taxes in order to meet the growing budget demands of the National Guard, as existential threats from our enemies grow along with the advancement of space travel technology?â Darr asked.The presidential hopeful replied that such a future is ânonsense,â adding that âthe round earth people, and you know who they are, these people have an agenda.âAfter declaring that the world is flat, Mr. Trump, as he has done before, again cited âthe Internetâ as his primary source of information. âThere are people out there, many people, and I mean missile experts, sailors, you name it, folks, and this is what theyâre saying. Itâs all on the Internet, itâs there.âThe flat earth conspiracy theory, like most conspiracy theories, is propagated primarily via the Internet. Internet forums and YouTube channels are dedicated to âenlighteningâ the vast majority who, as truthers explain, naively buy into the âglobe earth theoryâ that has been sold to them since birth.One piece of evidence that flat earth truthers present as proof that there is a global conspiracy against them, is the emblem used by the United Nations, implying that the intergovernmental organization is part of the conspiracy. In it, the planet is displayed as a flat earth, with the northern pole at the center, and southern hemisphere continents stretched out toward the circumference, just as the planet really is, according to truthers.In April, after stating that he is open to allowing Japan and South Korea to develop nuclear weapons to alleviate the financial costs of the United Statesâ role as âpolicemen to the world,â Trump also suggested minimizing the authority of the United Nations. âBy the way, United Nations,â Trump said, âsame thing, smaller numbers.âIn now deleted tweets, Trump also seemingly offered Biblical evidence of a flat earth.During an interview at ReCodeâs 2016 Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, Elon Musk, founder and CEO of SpaceX, a company that is developing the technology to make humans a multi-planetary species by colonizing Mars, said he would suggest a direct democracy for humans on Mars, as opposed to the United Statesâ version of representative democracy.When asked about the potential Trump presidency, following the nomineeâs flat earth claim, Musk replied, âIâm glad the framers of the constitution saw fit to ensure that the president was captain of a large ship with a small rudder. Thereâs a limit to how much harm you can do as president. I donât think itâs the finest moment in our democracy.âWhen pressed further regarding the unique dangers presented by a President Trump, Musk added, âOh what the hell do I care? Iâm moving to Mars.â",1

Until the investigations into the âscamming activitiesâ into Trumpâs Charity organisations are finished, Trump is literally banned from any charitable activities or from making donations. The New York Attorney General is investigating Trumpâs activities.âItâs my understanding that [the Trump Foundation] canât make donations now, while itâs under investigation by NY AG,â Washington Postâs David Farenthold tweeted Friday night.The tweet was in response to White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee-Sandersâ saying she hadnât yet asked the president whether the funds would come from Trumpâs personal checkbook or from his foundation.Donald Trump, the Presidentâs son also ran a charity that is under investigation after it was revealed that the âcharitable organisationâ was funnelling money donated to the charity to be used for personal reasons or to pay for events. The money funnelled out of these charities in some way ended directly in Trumpâs pocket.The Eric Trump Foundation is also under investigation by the New York AG after reports revealed the father and son foundations were âself-dealingâ funds to each other.Eric Trump was the patron of St.Judeâs Children Hospital and used his high profile to raise millions of dollars for the hospital. An investigation later revealed that Eric Trump was funnelling millions of dollars from St.Judâs Childrenâs hospital into his fatherâs organisation and businesses.Follow this link to find the detailed report on how money from Eric Trump charity foundation was shifted into his fatherâs businesses can be found on CNNSt.Judeâs Childrenâs Hospital has since severed all ties with Eric Trump and his father.So while Trump made headlines after saying he will donate $1 million to hurricane Harvey victims, few Americans knew that actually Trumpâs charity organisations are under investigation for misappropriation of the millions of dollars they have collected over the years meant to help the causes they claim to support.Until those investigations are finalized, Trump and his family are not allowed to be involved in Charitable organisations, raising funds for charity, or making donations.However, Trump can continue to raise funds for campaigns and political reasons as this operates under different regulations as Charitable giving.Trump also pledged $1 million to hurricane Sandy victims in New Jersey in 2012 but 5 years later, they have never seen a dime!",1

100,Ruth Ginsburg Threatens To âResign From SCOTUSâ If Trump Is Elected President,http://therightists.com/ruth-ginsburg-threatens-to-resign-from-scotus-if-trump-is-elected/,"The Supreme Court is in recess for the summer, but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took some time to reflect on its future composition, which will chiefly depend on who is elected president in November. Asked on Thursday about the prospect of Donald Trump being handed the job of selecting the next crop of justices, she seemed uneasy at the thought. âI donât want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs,â she told The Associated Press in a wide-ranging interview that also touched on the loss of her dear friend Antonin Scalia and some of the courtâs biggest rulings in the term that ended in late June.âI really dislike that man for a number of reasons, and although I am not supposed to put forth my personal views because of my position, I still feel obligated to do whatever I can in order to let the public know that thereâs still time to make the right choice,â she added. âDonald Trump is a man who has accumulated his vast wealth not because of his business prowess, but because of the fact that much of it was inherited from his father and grandfather. In fact, when it comes to making important decisions, I donât recall him ever making the right one, and thatâs not the type of man that should be at the head of this country.âAfter opening fire at the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, Ginsberg turned to her own plans should Donald Trump actually become the new President of the United States. âThereâs no need to beat around the bush, so Iâm just going to go ahead and say it â I will resign my position as a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States if that happens. I cannot imagine performing my duties under the constant pressure of waking up in the morning and having to go to work knowing that every ruling we as an institution make will be viewed through the prism of a Trump presidency. I can tolerate this charade of a presidential campaign, but I could not live with him as president,â she said.âI am a woman who has lived long enough, and I am proud to say Iâve had a prosperous and fulfilled life,â Justice Ginsberg argued. âHowever, I am too old and too far gone to be forced to put up with the idiotic and surreal presidency of a man who up until yesterday cared for no one else but his own deep pocket. I fear that kind of situation would go against the very principles that are the building blocks of the Constitution of the United States. I see no purpose in continuing to perform my professional duties when Iâm aware that everything I say and do will most likely be shot down by a man so ignorant he probably requires GPS just to find his belly button while taking a shower.â",1

And weâre not doing anything about it.âHe added that it was âlazy American womenâ who brought about the downfall of the economy, because âthey sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them.â âIâm not sure how exactly we got to this point, but weâre here and we need to move. Like, yesterday,â he said.âMark my words and mark them well,â he addressed the crowd. âHillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, sheâs a woman herself and not just any woman; sheâs a self-made woman. So you better believe what sheâs saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times.ââSecond, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a free-loader when your husband is the bread-winner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. Sheâs been all that and sheâs learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add,â Biden continued.âTodayâs women are pampered and arenât used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own,â the vice president said. âTheyâre too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is theyâve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics: when a sought-after commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher.ââNow, thatâs all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, itâs the economy thatâs missing out on valuable workforce. And thatâs why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces. And like I said, Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it, which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States. We need to heal this country, folks, not run it into the ground even deeper,â Biden concluded.",1

In the Name of Humanity We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America!â reads a full-page ad placed in the New York Times on Wednesday by the group Refuse Racism. âDonald Trump, the President-elect, is assembling a regime of grave danger,â the ad says. âMillions of people in the US and around the world are filled with deep anxiety, fear and disgust. Our anguish is right and just. Our anger must now become massive resistance â before Donald Trump is inaugurated and has the full reins of power in his hands.â</span>Other Hollywood celebrities who have also joined the campaign, however, are calling for an all-out strike that would span the entire movie industry in the hopes that such a move would urge the President-elect to resign from his position as the newly elected President of the United States. âWeâre calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood, starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props, movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops,â a spokesperson for the Refuse Racism group told The New York Times. âItâs about time people understood that weâre the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us, not the other way around.âAsked to elaborate on why the group is targeting Hollywood out of all the industries in the country as their bargaining chip, the spokesperson argued that Hollywood âis, simply put, the base of the entire modern American culture. It is the foundation of the country, so to speak, the glue thatâs holding it together. And think about what happens when you destroy the foundation of a house. It comes crashing down, right? Well, thatâs exactly whatâs going to happen to America unless Donald Trump realizes how real the danger of that actually is, and chooses to step down as President of his own free will. And while weâre on the subject, between you and me â nobody wants Hollywood to stop doing its thing, but this is a necessary move.ââBesides, itâs not like the billionaire-businessman-turned-president hasnât ventured into movies in his day, right? So, heâll understand firsthand whatâs going to happen if Hollywood goes to strike. Without the work of Hollywood and the lifestyle promoted by it, there will literally be no more America to rule for Trump. So, in effect, itâs not us that are going to force Donald Trump to resign his office; itâs the people of America who are going to make him do it, because the Godâs honest truth is â without Hollywood, there is no America. Itâs like trying to run Nazi Germany without Hitler at the forefront â it just becomes pointless,â the spokesperson concluded.",1

Yes, I would love to see more businessmen go into politics because I believe they would bring in an entirely different mindset and strategies than what weâre used to seeing traditionally,â she opined.And then she just had to go on. âIn fact, when you say businessmen and women, I canât help but think of a particular one that I would just love to see running for the presidency at some point in the future,â Clinton added. âI donât know what it is exactly about him, I canât quite put my finger on it, but my instinct is almost never wrong. And itâs telling me that Donald Trump would be very successful if he were to venture into politics in the future.âAsked to elaborate on her statement, the former Secretary of State argued that she thinks that businessmen âcanât be boughtâ and that theyâre âvery honest.â âAnd I think that goes especially for Donald Trump, whose successful projects and business ventures have made him synonymous with big business and, more importantly, creating thousands of jobs. I also think he understands the philanthropic and charitable side of things quite well, which is a crucial skill for any politician,â she praised her current counter-candidate.âI think he has a lot to offer to this country and its people, especially when weâre talking about the economy,â she continued. âDonald Trump has single-handedly helped stop the recession, more so than dozens of other so-called billionaires. And I donât know how the experts on the matter feel, but in my book thatâs hard evidence of the manâs business prowess and integrity, as well. And I think everyone would agree those are commendable character traits for anyone looking to tackle the most difficult problems and challenges in the world, quite literally.ââSo, yes â Donald Trump is someone I could very easily see winning the support of the people. And I donât think he would do that with his flammable rhetoric and negotiation skills â which are both things heâs known for â but with common sense and respect for his fellow countrymen. But, most of all â I think his relationship with the opposite sex would bring him the most political points. I think he respects women and treats them as equals and I also think that would bring him a significant lead over anyone unlucky enough to be running against him,â she ominously concluded in her 2013 speech.",1

105,Melania Trump Bans Monsanto Products From The White House,http://yournewswire.com/melania-trump-bans-monsanto/,"First Lady Melania Trump has banned Monsanto products from her household after learning of the health effects associated with consuming genetically modified (GM) corn.First Lady Melania Trump has banned Monsanto products from the White House after learning of the health effects associated with consuming genetically modified (GM) corn, according to reports.While public debate rages about the safety of genetically modified food, Melania Trump says that as far as she is concerned, GM products are best avoided.âBarronâs health has improved out of sight since we started eating organic, non genetically modified food,â the First Lady said.After researching exactly where Monsantoâs genetically modified corn appeared in her familyâs diet and becoming concerned about potential negative health effects, Melania Trump said she was âamazed at the place this company has in the food chainâ.The First Lady, who proudly describes herself as a âfull-time momâ, then realized that Monsanto produces other genetically modified crops such as soy, sugar beets, and cotton â and these products form the foundation of many Americanâs diets.In the interests of her son Barronâs health â as well as her own â Melania decided to eliminate processed foods containing GM crops from her family home.But as Melania explained, this wasnât as easy as it sounds. 70 to 80 percent of American processed foods contain genetically engineered ingredients, according to the Grocery Manufacturers of America.While the FDA attempts to convince us that GM foods are safe, scientists working for the agency have repeatedly warned that the opposite is true.These brave FDA scientists, speaking out against the official company line pushed by their corrupt superiors, have repeatedly warned that GM foods can create unpredictable, hard-to-detect side effects, including allergies, toxins, new diseases, and nutritional problems.They have urged long-term safety studies, but have been ignored by the agency.Health RisksSeveral animal studies indicate serious health risks associated with genetically modified food, including infertility, immune problems, accelerated aging, faulty insulin regulation, and changes in major organs and the gastrointestinal system. The American Academy of Environmental Medicine has asked physicians to advise all patients to avoid GM foods.Yet since 1996, Americans have been eating GM ingredients in most processed foods. Why isnât the FDA protecting us?The sad fact is that we cannot rely on the FDA to protect us. We must do our own research and educate ourselves.In the First Ladyâs case, her self-education led to her total ban on Monsanto tainted products in her household, exclusively ordering organic products that were not grown with GM seeds.Melania said that in order to live up to the commitment she had to do a lot of research.âI have a friend who is a sustainable food advocate, and I got in touch with dozens of health food stories and manufacturers to ask where they sourced their products,â the First Lady said.In order to completely avoid Monsanto products, the consumer must research the origins of their food.âI spent a lot of time at farmersâ markets asking farmers what seed companies they buy from, googling on my phone before making purchases.âIt took a few months but I finally managed to get Monsanto out of my life completely.âThe influence that Monsanto has over U.S. food production is profound, and deeply disturbing. Once you start looking, you realize that Monsanto is everywhere. And, unfortunately, their influence is not benign.But as Melania Trump says, once you educate yourself and then make the effort to avoid Monsanto, you will find peace of mind, and the health of your family will improve.",1
106,Police: Charlottesville Was âInside Jobâ To Ignite Race War,http://yournewswire.com/charlottesville-inside-job/,"A Charlottesville police officer claims the riots, which pitched white supremacists against Antifa, were set up to further the agenda of the elites.A Charlottesville police officer has come forward to express his anger at being told to âstand downâ by the city mayor during violent clashes between protestors. He also claims the protests, which pitched âwhite supremacistsâ against members of Antifa, were âset upâ to further the agenda of the elites.âWe [Charlotesville police] were ordered to bring the rival groups together. As soon as they were in contact with each other, we were told to stand down. It was outrageous. We werenât allowed to arrest anyone without asking the mayor first. We werenât even allowed to stop the driver as he sped away.ââThe event was being set up as far back as at least May and it went like clockwork.âMichael Signer, the mayor of Charlottesville, ordered police to stand down during the most chaotic and destructive period of the protests â despite police protests against the orders.âWe wanted to do our job and keep the peace. But these mother******s in charge really want to destroy America.âFox News reporter Doug McKelway was on the scene in Charlottesville and he backs up the police officerâs claims.âI can say, havig been in Emancipation Park from early on that morning, that what I saw with my own two eyes confirms what this law enforcement source told us. At least from all visible apearances. We saw people coming out of that park who had headwounds, who were bleeding from the head, people walking into that park with bats, with sticks â you saw what they were wearing â helmets, body armor, they had come â and this pertains to both sides â they had come to do damage.. you cannot help but notice from that video that police had been more pro-active, they could have potentially calmed this thing down to some degree.âMichael Signer is a Virginia Democratic activist with close ties to Barack Obama and John Podesta. Before landing the Charlottesville mayor job he previously worked closely with Podesta at the Center of American Progress and worked with him again on Barack Obamaâs State Department Transition Team.The New World Order, led in the United States by elite operatives Obama, Podesta, Soros, Clinton and company, are pulling out all the stops to create division through chaos and destruction. Crowds of paid protestors and useful psychopaths are being sent into pitched battle against one another to sour the mood of the nation and further divide us all.They are manipulating and controlling newsworthy events in order to maintain power and control over the public, and to swing public opinion.Deep state operativesThe man accused of being a neo-Nazi and murdering a woman by deliberately driving into her during protests in Charlottesville is in reality a supporter of Hillary Clinton and member of Antifa in receipt of funding by George Soros.White supremacist and âUnite the Rightâ leader, Jason Kessler, has been exposed as a supporter of former President Obama and the a hardline member of far-left Occupy movement.When did he change his political leaning? According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (an organization that is certainly no friend to Conservatives), Kessler revealed his political transformation around November 2016, the same month Donald Trump won the presidential election.If you think that is suspicious, wait until you learn about the other actors in this enormous set-up event.First man on the sceneBrennan Gilmore was âon the sceneâ and was the author of the first viral tweet about Charlottesville. He was later interviewed by MSNBC. He was presented as an accidental witness. But who is he really?Gilmore worked in Africa as a State Department foreign officer under Hillary Clinton. The New York Times mentioned this âcoincidenceâ â and then later deleted it. Brennan Gilmore was also involved with the Kony hoax in 2012, and he is currently Chief of Staff for Tom Perrielo, who is running for Governor of Virginia and received $380k from George Soros.So the first man on the scene, whose tweet went viral, and who was later interviewed on mainstream news as a witness, just happened to be a State Department insider with a long history of involvement in psy-ops? If you think this isnât fishy, how about this â since the Charlottesville protests and his appearance in the media, his information was suddenly removed from State Department websites.The elites know we are onto them, and they are trying to cover their tracks. They can censor Google and social media and close down accounts, but they will never be able to stop us sharing information and speaking to each other.",1
107,NPR: 25 Million Votes For Clinton âCompletely Fakeâ â She Lost Popular Vote,http://yournewswire.com/npr-25-million-fake-clinton-votes/,"NPR admit Hillary Clinton 'lost the popular vote' as 25 million fake votes are discoveredA study published by NPR reveals that over 25 million Hillary Clinton votes were completely fraudulent, meaning that the Democratic candidate actually lost the popular vote by a huge margin.A study by the Pew Center claiming that over 800,000 non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton failed to take into account dead and fraudulent voters which totalled over 25 million âregistered votersâ.According to reports, illegal aliens combined with dead voters and âmultiple stateâ voters explains why Hillary appeared to have won the popular vote over Trump during this years presidential race.Infowars.com reports:âA report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1.8 million dead people are currently registered to vote, and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate,â NPR reported in 2012, which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats.And many of the dead, registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave, most recently in Philadelphia, Penn. and Colorado.Itâs also worth noting that the U.S. population has increased since 2012, meaning that thereâs likely more dead and invalid voters than before.ââ¦The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state,â NPR added.Thatâs because when a new resident registers to vote in a state, officials usually never bother to tell his former state about the change in voter residency.Under the âcatch and releaseâ immigration program by the Obama administration, illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials, so it was theoretically possible for non-citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally, then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer-funded bus dropped them off.Clinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election, including dense urban areas in New York and California, yet she only won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump â and that Democrats would have depended more on illegal votes.A portion of the 24 million invalid voter registrations combined with a portion of the 1.8 million dead voters and the over 800,000 known illegal voters could explain the difference of 2.8 million votes, and itâs worth noting that the 800,000 figure could be a low, conservative estimate.That said, a popular vote victory is meaningless; if the president was elected by popular vote, then both Trump and Clinton would have campaigned in entirely different states because only densely population regions of the U.S. would decide who would become president.Without the electoral college, the United States of America would be reduced to the United States of New York and California, with 48 other vassal states.Yet notice how Clinton campaigned in other, less populated states.  They knew the popular vote was meaningless ahead of the election.However, the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal, invalid and dead voters.",1
108,Obama To Resign January 1st Amid New Benghazi Revelations,http://nationalreport.net/obama-resign-january-1st-amid-new-benghazi-revelations/,"According to several senior-ranking White House officials, President Barack Obama will resign from office on January 1st 2015, after learning that a so-called âSmoking Gunâ story regarding the Benghazi scandal will soon be revealed. Those sources claim Obama will announce his resignation shortly after the midterm elections in November.The decision to resign came after reporters from Fox News were allegedly contacted in August by a survivor of the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack, who came forward with shocking video evidence that Obama, then- White House Chief of Staff Jacob Lew, and then- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton knew that an attack on the US diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya was âimminent,â and intentionally ordered key security personnel to leave the facility and travel eight blocks away.Sources at Fox News say that the unidentified survivor allegedly recorded a video teleconference on his cell phone in which Lew gave the orders, while Obama and Clinton watched on. âYou donât want a guy like Mitt Romney deciding your budget,â Lew supposedly states in the video, which Fox News has not yet released. âWe need to win this thing, and that means we need to make some sacrifices. Let me be clear, no one will be harmed in this. Weâre sacrificing a few buckets of paint, thatâs all. We just need a little nudge in the polls.âThe sources at Fox say the network was prepared to air the video on August 23rd, but House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) convinced them to hold off on releasing the footage. White House sources say two unidentified reporters from Fox News joined Issa in a private meeting with Obama this past weekend, on August 30th, and agreed to not reveal the video if Obama agreed to resign. White House senior staff negotiated with Issa and the reporters so Obama could stay in office until the end of the year, and that he would announce the resignation in November, shortly after the midterms. Why they agreed to those terms is unclear.Obamaâs resignation has been highly sought after by conservatives and Tea Party figures since well before he actually took office in January of 2009. The Benghazi scandal continues to ignite fiery debate across the United States, despite a full lack of evidence, until now, of any wrongdoing on the behalf of the Obama Administration. In August, it was learned that the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee cleared Obama and his team of any wrongdoing in the Benghazi scandal.If the story proves true, Obama will resign at noon on January 1st, 2015, and Vice President Joe Biden will be sworn into office. It is unclear who the next Vice President will be, but incumbent White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough is strongly favored for the role. Bidenâs office reportedly scheduled âemergency meetingsâ with Nancy Pelosi, Tim Kaine, Elizabeth Warren, and Maryland Governor Martin OâMalley for Tuesday and Wednesday, and some speculate these meetings might be related to a future VP decision, though no sources could confirm the rumor.",1

The Grand Canyon and the Smithsonian are not going anywhere.â Obama continued, âThe International Museum of Muslim Cultures is sacred. That is why I have taken it upon myself to use my own personal funds to re-open this historic piece of American culture.âThe International Museum of Muslim Cultures closed its doors Tuesday as parts of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach an agreement on spending. On Monday, the Senate rejected the latest budget proposal from the House of Representatives. The fiscal standoff stems in large part from Republican attempts to block President Obamaâs healthcare initiative.âThe Muslim community deserves our full acceptance and respect,â Obama said. âWe have killed millions of Muslims overseas since the September 11th attacks. They are not all bad. In fact most of them are good. So during this shutdown, now is a great time to learn about the faith of Islam. I encourage all of you to celebrate the Muslim community, the âSunnahâ and the magic of the âQuranâ. All of this can be found at the newly re-opened International Museum of Muslim Cultures.âKhaled Matei who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhoodâs Freedom and Justice Party told CNN he is pleased with Obama and his actions. âI spoke with President Obama by telephone yesterday and personally thanked him for what he is doing for the Muslim community,â Matei said. âThis is definitely a step in the right direction I explained to him. Praise Allah.âObama finished the press conference explaining to reporters how thrilled he is to see the museum open again. âFolks, this is a time to focus on things that are important to us in America. Sure, we would all like to see the government open, it just is not that simple. What is simple is me funding the International Museum of Muslim Cultures so that it can stay open during this horrible time in our nationâs history, all thanks to the echo chamber which is called the Tea Party.âThe International Museum of Muslim Cultures is located at 201 E Pascagoula Street in Jackson, Mississippi. It is open Tuesday â Friday from 10:00 am â 5:00 pm. The museum is closed Friday from 1:00 pm â 3:00 pm in observance of the Jumah Prayer.",1

In July, Election Justice USA, for example, reported that without Clintonâs team committing egregious acts of voter fraud, Sanders would have been the man to lose to Donald Trump in the national election. Instead, we have Pantsuits McCriminal, and what happened Friday is absolute proof that she will do literally anything to win.Fox 10 Phoenix reports that nine illegal immigrants complete with fake identification and voter registration cards, and stolen social security numbers, voted at around 9 am a Desert Wind Middle School in Pinal County. At 10:30, the very same white van carrying the very same illegals was spotted at Santa Rosa Elementary School and they voted there as well. Just two hours later, the same group showed up at the Global Water Center to cast their vote.By this point, poll workers had been notified and one of those Poll Watchers liberals hate so much pretended to take a poll and asked them whom they had voted for. In broken English, one man who identified himself as Jose Gutierrez said âI am voting for Hillary Clinton many times.âAnd vote many times he did. Mr. âGutierrezâ and friends voted in two more locations, their spree ending in Maricopa County where a Sheriff was waiting for them. The nine beloved âundocumented personsâ as Democrats call them were arrested and charged with attempted in-person voter fraud and several other charges. Unfortunately, only one will be deported.âThey were just enthusiastic.

111,Obama Family Rumored to Be in the Market for Expensive Marthaâs Vineyard Property,http://thepoliticalinsider.com/obama-marthas-vineyard-property/,"President Barack Obama spent eight years warning about the supposed threat of man-made global warming, which included massive and catastrophic rising sea levels. Conservative Republicans and President Donald Trump, we were told, are on the âwrong side of historyâ when it comes to climate change.But the Obama familyâs actions speak louder than words. And what the Obamas just did contradicts all their talk about climate change.The Boston Globe reports the former first family is ready to spend tens of millions of dollars on a property right along that same ocean line we were warned about. Realtors arenât sharing details yet, but the rumor is that they are purchasing a luxurious location in Marthaâs Vineyard, along with other expensive, less-populated regions to the north.Considering Obama never held a real job in his life, this is an extraordinary move:Word around the island is that the Obamas, whoâve rented a place on the Vineyard for the past several summers, are looking to buy. The former first family has many friends on Marthaâs Vineyard â Harvard professors Henry Louis âSkipâ Gates and Charles Ogletree, and former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, to name just a few â and they would like to own a place of their own on the island.The 44th president and his wife, Michelle, are believed to be focused âup island,â looking at homes or buildable lots in the rural communities of Aquinnah, Chilmark, and West Tisbury. (Itâs worth noting that the Obamas have always rented âup island,â including for a two-week stay this summer.)No oneâs talking, least of all realtors, but weâre told that one property that may be getting a long look is a magnificent waterfront outpost in Aquinnah owned by Caroline Kennedy and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg. A few years ago, the couple, who inherited from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis the 377-acre Red Gate Farm overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, subdivided the property and put two parcels on the market.Both are still available â but they donât come cheap. Sothebyâs International Realty and Hancock Real Estate in Chilmark are listing a 75-acre parcel for $15 million, and a second 40-acre parcel for $12 million. The descriptions for each read like something out of a fairytale: âThe vast acreage and exquisite dune-fringed sands give the sense of a world apart in an idyllic landscape which has remained virtually unchanged over the centuries. Perched on a southwest-facing ridge, the potential homesite commands glorious views to the oceanâs brilliant blue waters and sunsets in the midst of this sublime seaside paradise of pastoral coastal heathlands and high dunes.âAnd as shown by real estate websites, the property would be the exact wrong place to buy a home if you believe Al Goreâs predictions about rising sea levels:The lots, such as the one shown above, cost approximately $15 millionâ¦ and thatâs just the cost before any home is built. The luxurious properties must be built to withstand erosion of land and require unique painting to avoid damage due to the surrounding salt water. And none of that includes serious issues involving licensing, zoning, permits, and ground preparation.Another reason to laugh at the Obamas is they may be building on top of land that was stolen from Native Americans!âThe Obamas need to check all permits, and [see] if their land can be subdivided, and if itâs on Wampanoag land,â says Julianne Kavoussi, who has owned a home in the Edgartown part of the Vineyard for 20 years. The Wampanoag are Native American people who, she says, own a good portion of Aquinnah.It wasnât long ago that we learned Al Goreâs house uses 34 times the amount of energy used by the average American household. Now, the Obamas are being the hypocrites we always knew they were.",1

I also worry a little it will cause donor confusion vis a vis Priorities.America Votes, which works with over 400 state and national partner organizations to advance progressive policies, win elections, andprotect every Americans right to vote, has received millions in funding from Soros.She is having dinner with George Soros tonight, Abedin responds.Do you know much about America Votes? As Greg Speed explained to me, they are the coordinated campaign for various outside groups.Soros is a big supporter of the group and hes [sic] going to ask her tonight if she will come to a fundraiser for them at his house in December.

113,CLINTON DESCRIBES SANDERS SUPPORTERS AS BASEMENT-DWELLERS & BARISTAS IN LEAKED RECORDING,https://www.infowars.com/clinton-describes-sanders-supporters-as-basement-dwellers-baristas-in-leaked-recording/,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made forthright remarks about Bernie Sanders supporters during a private meeting with fundraisers, an audiofrom which has been leaked following an email hack.Theres just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free healthcare, that what weve done hasnt gone far enough, and that we just need to,you know, go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that means, and half the people dont know what that means, but its something that they deeply feel,Clinton said during a Q&A with potential donors in McLean in Virginia, in February, when she was still in a close primary race with Sanders.The frontrunner to become the next US President said that herself and other election observers had been bewildered by the rise of the populist,nationalist, xenophobic, discriminatory Republican candidates, presumably Donald Trump, on the one side, and the radical left-wing idealists on the other.Clinton painted herself as a moderate and realistic contrast to the groundswell.I am occupying from the center-left to the center-right. And I dont have much company there.Because it is difficult when youre running to be president, and you understand how hard the job is  I dont want to overpromise, said Clinton,who has customarily eschewed political spectrum labels. According to the Washington Free Beacon, which posted the audio of Clintons remarks,the recording was attached to an email sent out by a campaign staffer, which has been hacked. It is unclear if the leak is the work of the samehackers who got hold of a trove of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails in July.In the session, Clinton called for an understanding of the motives of Sanders younger backers, while describing them in terms that fluctuatebetween patronizing and unflattering.Some are new to politics completely. Theyre children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents basement. They feel they got their educationand the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they dont see much of a future, said Clinton, who obtained thesupport of about 2,800 delegates, compared to approximately 1,900 for Sanders, when the results were tallied in July.If youre feeling like youre consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesnt pay a lot, and doesnt have some otherladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing.Despite well-publicized tensions, particularly between the more vocal backers, Sanders endorsed Clinton at the Democratic National Convention two monthsago, and the two politicians have campaigned together this week, sharing the stage. Following the leak, the Clinton campaign has not apologized for the audio,insisting that it shows that the nominee and is listening to the concerns of the most diverse, open-minded generation in history.As Hillary Clinton said in those remarks , she wants young people to be idealistic and set big goals, said her spokesman Glen Caplin.She is fighting for exactly millennial generation cares more about  a fairer, more equal, just world.In other parts of the 50-minute recording, Clinton spoke about US capacity to retaliate against foreign hackers that would serve as a deterrence andsaid she would be inclined to mothball the costly upgrade of the Long Range Standoff (LRSO) missile program.",1

Maybe he [Trump] was watching CNN fake news, Bernie jests attempting to mock Trump, before asking, What do you think?It was a joke! the senator explains to a somewhat bewildered Burnett, but it was too late  the senator was cut off and he stopped receiving audio to his earpiece.Erin? Are we on? Bernie asks.It looks like weve lost connection with Senator Sanders, Burnett attempts to recover.The interview continued on the other side of a commercial break, but the flub was deleted from CNNs entire interview upload.In the past few weeks, the network has strongly objected to the term fake news.Just the other day CNN anchor Chris Cuomo equated the term, invented by the left, to a racial denigration on par with the N-word.But it seems President Donald Trumps continual mocking of the fake news outlet has worn them down to the point they cant take a joke.To me, that makes it ten times funnier.",1
115,REPORT: THREE MILLION VOTES IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAST BY ILLEGAL ALIENS,https://www.infowars.com/report-three-million-votes-in-presidential-election-cast-by-illegal-aliens/,"Three million votes in the U.S. presidential election were cast by illegal aliens, according to Greg Phillips of the VoteFraud.org organization.If true, this would mean that Donald Trump still won the contest despite widespread vote fraud and almost certainly won the popular vote.We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens, tweeted Phillips after reporting that the group had completed an analysis of a database of 180 million voter registrations.Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million. Consulting legal team, he added.According to current indications, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by around 630,000 votes, although around 7 million ballots remain uncounted.Virtually all of the votes cast by 3 million illegal immigrants are likely to have been for Hillary Clinton, meaning Trump might have won the popular vote when this number is taken into account.Vote fraud using ballots cast in the name of dead people and illegal alien voters was a huge concern before the election.On the morning of the election there were 4 million dead people on U.S. voter rolls.Although some states require some form of ID before voting, California, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Washington, D.C. all require no identification before voting.",1
116,BOMBSHELL: AT LEAST 25 MILLION DEAD AND FRAUDULENT REGISTERED VOTERS IN 2016,https://www.infowars.com/bombshell-at-least-25-million-dead-and-fraudulent-registered-voters-in-2016/,"A study revealing that over 800,000 non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton doesnt account for dead and fraudulent voters, which accounted for over 25 million registered voters during the 2012 presidential election  and little has changed since then.Illegal alien voters combined with dead and multiple state voters could easily explain Clintons popular vote margin over Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, especially considering that her victory came from Democratic-controlled counties known for illegal immigration and loose voter ID laws such as in New York and California.A report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1.8 million dead people are currently registered to vote, and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate, NPR reported in 2012, which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats.And many of the dead, registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave, most recently in Philadelphia, Penn. and Colorado.Its also worth noting that the U.S. population has increased since 2012, meaning that theres likely more dead and invalid voters than before.The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state, NPR added.Thats because when a new resident registers to vote in a state, officials usually never bother to tell his former state about the change in voter residency.Under the catch and release immigration program by the Obama administration, illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials, so it was theoretically possible for non-citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally, then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer-funded bus dropped them off.Clinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election, including dense urban areas in New York and California, yet she only won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump  and that Democrats would have depended more on illegal votes.A portion of the 24 million invalid voter registrations combined with a portion of the 1.8 million dead voters and the over 800,000 known illegal voters could explain the difference of 2.8 million votes, and its worth noting that the 800,000 figure could be a low, conservative estimate.That said, a popular vote victory is meaningless; if the president was elected by popular vote, then both Trump and Clinton would have campaigned in entirely different states because only densely population regions of the U.S. would decide who would become president.Without the electoral college, the United States of America would be reduced to the United States of New York and California, with 48 other vassal states.Yet notice how Clinton campaigned in other, less populated states.  They knew the popular vote was meaningless ahead of the election.However, the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal, invalid and dead voters.",1

It is now believed that over 5,000 out-of-state voters may have voted for Hillary Clinton on election day in New Hampshire because the state allows same-day registration.  New Hampshire was a close race in the 2016 Presidential election. Hillary won the four electoral votes, however; it took a week to count the votes because it was tight. Hillary received 348,521 votes, while Trump picked up 345,789. Trump   lost by 0.4 percent.  As previously reported, Hillary Clintons former top campaign lawyer, Marc Elias is behind a New Hampshire lawsuit to block a law which would force people who are registering to vote to show a form of I.D. Figures.  The Democrats are pulling out all the stops to prevent voter I.D. laws because without illegal aliens, dead people or people being bussed in to vote, the Democrats would never win another election.  Via Washington Times:  More than 6,500 people registered to vote in New Hampshire on Nov. 8 using out-of-state drivers licenses, and since then the vast majority have neither obtained an in-state license nor registered a motor vehicle.  Conservatives say the states same-day registration is an invitation for fraud because of loose proof-of-residence rules. New Hampshire House Speaker Shawn Jasper, a Republican, issued the numbers Thursday based on inquiries he made to the Department of State, which oversees elections, and the Department of Safety. Here are the numbers:  6,540 people registered and voted on Nov. 8, based on presenting out-of-state licenses.  As of Aug. 30, about 15 percent (1,014 of the voters) had been issued New Hampshire drivers licenses.  ?f the remaining 5,526, barely more than 200 (3.3 percent) had registered a motor vehicle in New Hampshire.  New Hampshire law gives drivers 60 days upon establishing residence to obtain a state license.  But more than 80 percent of voters who registered on Nov. 8 using out-of-state drivers licenses, or 5,313 of them, neither had a state license nor registered a motor vehicle almost 10 months later.  It is well known that people are bussed in to vote in New Hampshire. This is why the Democrats are fiercely working to stop any investigation into vote fraud and are working to prevent any type of voter I.D. laws. Strict laws would have tipped New Hampshire in Donald Trumps favor.",1

Assange: Look, I thinkyou know, we are aware how politics works in the United States. Whoeverwhatever political party gets into government is going to merge with the bureaucracy pretty damn fast. It will be in a position where it has some levers in its hand. Also, Bernie Sanders was independent candidate trying to get the nomination trough the Democratic Party.

The mainstream media has neglected to report on a BIG find by Dr. Ben Carson. The Trump cabinet is a winning cabinet.  Dr. Carson dug into the agencies records in a sweeping audit wherein he found substantial bookkeeping errors, which only prove either the incompetence or the corrupt nature of the previous administration led by former-president, Barack Obama.  The HUD report found $500 billion in fraud and mismanagement in the government agency.  What We Found  The total amounts of errors corrected in HUDs notes and consolidated financial statements were $516.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. There were several other unresolved audit matters, which restricted our ability to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to express an opinion. These unresolved audit matters relate to (1) the Office of General Counsels refusal to sign the management representation letter, (2) HUDs improper use of cumulative and first-in, first-out budgetary accounting methods of disbursing community planning and development program funds, (3) the $4.2 billion in nonpooled loan assets from Ginnie Maes stand-alone financial statements that we could not audit due to inadequate support, (4) the improper accounting for certain HUD assets and liabilities, and (5) material differences between HUDs subledger and general ledger accounts. This audit report contains 11 material weaknesses, 7 significant deficiencies, and 5 instances of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.  We took a screenshot of the .pdf file that outlines the findings by Dr. Carson and his team:  So far the Trump administration has had opposition from the left and the mainstream media.

All of those can be arranged with her trip when she moves out of America. Im sure they would love to have a C-List celebrity with no gratitude for the great American country she lives in as a millionaire.

Itâs been almost a year since the election, and now Hillaryâs blaming married women who voted for Donald Trump for her loss to the president back in November.Still unwilling to take any responsibility for her loss to Donald Trump, Hillary continues to play the blame game.  So far, sheâs blamed everyone from her most trusted advisor, Huma Abedin, to the infamous socialist and fellow democrat Bernie Sanders, for the disastrous campaign and ridiculous ideas she championed last year. But she doesnât stop there anymore. Now itâs the fault of married women who voted for Donald Trump. According to the Daily Wire, the quintessential modern feminist Clinton says women were too scared to stand up to their husbands, boyfriends, and fathers, who told them to vote Republican, and since, clearly, women have no agency or ability to think for themselves, they listened.  Of course, thatâs according to Hillary. But she blamed socialist women as well. Clinton made the outrageous claims in an interview with NPR,where she also blamed the so-called âBernie Brosâ for bullying Democratic women into avoiding the more moderate Clinton in favor of the socialist, Bernie Sanders. âYou yourself in the book acknowledge that a good number of young women didnât vote for you, which is presumably not a sexist choice. They just werenât inspired by your message,â NPRâs Rachel Martin said during an interview with Clinton, out to promote her litany of excusesâ¦erâ¦recently released book, What Happened. âI think itâs a lot more complicated than that,â Clinton answered. âI did win the womenâs vote. I didnât win the vote of white women, but I got more white women votes than Barack Obama did,â she said. âWomen will have no empathy for you because they will be under tremendous pressure â and Iâm talking principally about white women â they will be under tremendous pressure from fathers, and husbands, and boyfriends and male employers, not to vote for âthe girl,ââ she said. âDaily Wire. But Clinton also said that even though women liked and respected her (an observation American women might disagree with generally) they were too afraid to stand up to the âoppressive Patriarchial handâ that often âforcesâ them to hide their allegiance to womankind. Clinton also tried pretty hard to convince NPR that she is taking the blame for her loss, but no one is buying this snake oil anymore: âI take ultimate responsibility for the loss,â Clinton said. âI was the candidate. I was the person whose name was on the ballot. And Iâll never get over that.â And even though she lost to one of the most hated candidates of all time, Hillary Clinton is refusing to go away. âIâm not going anywhere. I have the experience, I have the insight, I have the scars that I think give me not only the right but the responsibility to speak out,â Clinton said.",1

Given the fact that D.C. is where the politically powerful congregate, it stands to reason that the city would be a special target of satanists. What better way than to corrupt and bring down the United States, still the most powerful country in the world? Last year, we learnt that John Podesta, a longtime Clinton associate who chaired Hillary Clintonâs 2016 presidential campaign, partook of a satanic ritual called spirit cooking dinner â a âsacramentâ in Thelema founded by British satanist Aleister Crowley whose motto was âDo As Thou Wilt,â in which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are ingested. (See âEvidence that Hillary Clinton and her associates are satanistsâ) Yesterday, we learnt that Hillary Clinton who, were it not for the grace of God, would be the U.S. president now, admitted she had wanted to make and stick pins into voodoo dolls of her critics. Today, youâll find out about a very powerful D.C. woman who put hexes on her enemies. A curse is an expressed wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall another (or a place or object). A hex is more than a curse: To hex someone is to call upon a supernatural power, by means of âmagicâ or witchcraft, to bring ill on another. According to Wikipedia, the word âhexingâ comes from the German word for witchcraft. Sally Quinn, now 76, is a former Washington Post (WP) reporter who became the third (and last) wife of the late WP executive editor and later, vice president, Benjamin Bradlee. Bradlee became a celebrated and national figure during the presidency of Richard Nixon when he challenged the federal government over the right to publish the Pentagon Papers and oversaw the publication of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernsteinâs stories documenting the Watergate scandal. Together, from their marriage in 1978 until Bradleeâs death in 2014, the couple were among D.C.âs most powerful, dominating the cityâs social scene as its gatekeepers. In 2006, Quinn wrote that her parents were religious âbut didnât go to church,â and that she was an atheist since the time she was a small child because she could not believe in a God who allowed evil and bad things to happen to people, including her (unnamed) sickness when she was ten years old. John Nolte reports for Breitbart, Sept 12, 2017: âFor nearly 50 years, the entire social and political world of DC revolved around this couple. Bradlee and Quinn were the New Camelot (his career took off in large part because of his friendship with John F. Kennedy), the Gatekeepers of who was in and who was out, the Elite Deciders among our Ruling Class with the extraordinary power of the Washington Post, and by extension the rest of the mainstream media, to abuse and weaponize their will against the rest of us. Well, to put it as bluntly as possible, we are now learning that the Queen of Camelot is an occultist, a witch of sorts who honestly believes (according to her own new memoir) that she murdered three innocent people through the dark art of the hex: a young woman who committed suicide after flirting with Quinnâs boyfriend; a magazine editor who published an unflattering profile of her, who decades later died of cancer; a psychic who died of a cerebral hemorrhage before the end of the year after telling Quinn something she did not want to hear. [â¦] Quinnâs other acts of admitted wickedness include plotting to break up Bradleeâs marriage (which she did) and using the threat of adultery to bend Bradlee to her will.â Quinn âpracticed the occult in the most demonic ways imaginable well into adulthood.â She finally stopped hexing others, not out of a sense of remorse, but because she thought she was karmically responsible for the unusual illness of her and Bradleeâs only son, Quinn. Quinn Bradlee was born in 1982 (when Sally Quinn was 41 and Ben Bradlee was 61) with a rare and incurable disease called velo-cardio-facial syndrome, aka DiGeorge syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion or Shprintzen syndrome. Caused by the deletion of a small segment (30-40 genes) of chromosome 22, the syndrome occurs in only 1 in 4,000 people with afflictions that can include congenital heart problems, specific facial features, frequent infections, developmental delay, learning problems, cleft palate, kidney problems, hearing loss, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Graves disease. Nolte points out that what is almost as troubling as Sally Quinnâs witchcraft is âthe matter-of-fact way in which the Washington Post informs us of this bombshellâ under the chatty headline, ââSally Quinnâs hexes, marital ultimatums and visceral love of her sonâ. Nolte writes: âWe have just discovered that one of the primary movers and shakers of the last half-century is a practicing occultist, andâ¦ Nothing. Nobody cares. The information is dropped as though Quinnâs tell-all is the usual-usual about plastic surgeries and sex. Worse still, our Ruling Class is now joking about Quinn putting a deadly hex on President Trump. [â¦] Letâs just say it out loudâ¦ The most powerful people in our country are either outright occultists, are comfortable with witchcraft and Satanism, or are moving and shaking among those who are. Whether or not you believe in the power of the occult, that does not matter. Also beside the point is whether or not the Podestas and Quinn and those calling to have Trump hexed believe. What we do know is that these people have completely rejected any notion of a loving God, and moved towards darkness. Furthermore, we also know that this darkness is not about consenting adults behaving badly amongst themselves. Rather, this is about them attempting to harness a power to control others, to manipulate events to their will, to hurt or outright kill those who offend or insult them.â What is remarkable is that, although he was born with a hole in his heart and underwent heart surgery when he was three months old, after which he spent many years in and out of hospital and attended special schools for severe learning problems, and although he never received a religious education, Quinn Bradlee is a believing but non-church going Christian. In 2006 when Quinn was 24 years old, he told his mother that he believes in God. He said: âMy image of God is what Michaelangelo painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. God is a man stronger and more powerful than everybody else. I also believe that if you think about God, if you say his name all the time, then you will believe in him. It will be in your subconscious. . . . I knew you and Dad were not very religious people . . . . I didnât really understand that you didnât believe in God until a few years ago. I didnât know what âatheistâ meant. Itâs a very harsh word, very ugly word. Itâs like calling a black person the âNâ word. . . . Everything happens for a reason. Maybe itâs Godâs plan for me to go through this because I can handle it. . . . In a way, believing in God is like having a girlfriend that you love and care about. You feel safe with her. You feel safe with God, the way you would with your girlfriend. When you get married she will be with you in sickness and in health. Thatâs what I believe God will do when Iâm going through the hard times of life.â Now 35 years old, Josiah Quinn Bradlee is a filmmaker, author and advocate for the disabled.",1
125,Court Claims Nothing Wrong with Rigging PrimariesâDismisses Lawsuit Against DNC,no_url,"http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/08/29/court-claims-nothing-wrong-with-rigging-primaries-dismisses-lawsuit-against-dnc/The lawsuit brought about by Bernie Sanders supporters against the Democratic National Committee and its former chairperson Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has been dismissed after a court conceded that the DNC and Wasserman-Schultz rigged the primariesâbut were well within their rights to do soâseriously. After first assuming all the plaintiffâs allegations were true, for the purposes of weighing their claims, Judge William Zloch dismissed the lawsuit on several grounds. The plaintiffs alleged fraud on the part of the DNC in three different ways:1. The DNC did not remain unbiased as evidenced through the DNC emails Wikileaks published. 2. Donors to the DNC were defrauded because they donated to Bernie Sanders as a Democrat candidate and the fix was in for Hillary Clinton. 3. The potential for identity theft was demonstrated when the DNC failed to keep its database of donors and their personal information confidential. As Michael Sainato writes in the Observer, Zloch, dismissed the lawsuit after several months of litigation during which DNC attorneys argued that the DNC would be well within their rights to rig primaries and select their own candidate. âIn evaluating Plaintiffsâ claims at this stage, the Court assumes their allegations are trueâthat the DNC and Wasserman Schultz held a palpable bias in favor Clinton and sought to propel her ahead of her Democratic opponent,â the court order dismissing the lawsuit stated. Zloch concluded the plaintiffs failed to prove they were materially affected by the alleged bias with which the DNC engaged. He wrote: âThe Court must now decide whether Plaintiffs have suffered a concrete injury particularized to them, or one certainly impending, that is traceable to the DNC and its former chairâs conductâthe keys to entering federal court. The Court holds that they have not.â The overwhelming opinion of those who have actually read WikiLeaksâ leaked DNC email database appears to be that the DNC, Wasserman-Schultz, and the mainstream media all colluded to ensure Clinton would earn the DNC nomination. This was evident on numerous occasions, many of which were caught on live video and openly admitted. As The Free Thought Project has extensively reported, influential donors to the DNC are suing their political party for fraud in the 2016 presidential election where they say their candidate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, was discriminated against. High-ranking members of the DNC, by way of Wikileaksâ DNC email publications, were caught favoring Hillary Clinton over Sanders and actively working to subvert his chances at winning the partyâs nomination.Judge Zloch dismissed the lawsuit on technicalities (several of the plaintiffs lived outside of the courtâs jurisdiction) and precedents (donors to nonprofits have no legal recourse as to what the organization does with the donations). Zloch never really addressed the claims of the plaintiffs, only whether or not they had a legal claim for damages. Zloch admonished the plaintiffs his court was not the place to air their grievances. Instead, they should have done so at the ballot box, inside the DNC, and to work inside the systemâa system they clearly believe to be rife with corruption. Zloch wrote: âThis Order, therefore, concerns only technical matters of pleading and subject-matter jurisdiction. To the extent Plaintiffs wish to air their general grievances with the DNC or its candidate selection process, their redress is through the ballot box, the DNCâs internal workings, or their right of free speechânot through the judiciary.âZloch dismissed the case against the DNC and Wasserman-Schultz by declaring, âthe Court finds that the named Plaintiffs have not presented a case that is cognizable in federal court.â One of the plaintiffs in the case, Jared Beck, went off! Hereâs what he had to say in response to the dismissal and itâs epic! His rant starts at the 9-minute mark. His reaction describes the deaths of process server Shawn Lucas, DNC data manager Seth Rich, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Beranton Whisenant alludes to the Deep State, and points the finger of blame at the Military Industrial Complex. âWhat really disappoints me about our society, H.A., is the fact that we had two witnesses die in this case, and I still have these f***ing people who call themselves âjournalistsâ mocking usâ¦ denigrating us for being concerned about that. Ya know, it goes beyond a lack of awareness in this country. This country has a vicious, corrupt coreâ¦ and the MOST vicious, corrupt people are sitting in D.C. right now, running the show and forming the media elite and establishment that surrounds and protects them, and promulgates their bullshit all over the airwaves. And I am sick and f***ing tired of living in this country and having those be the people that run the show. We see our clients lose in court, all the time. We see them get shafted by the healthcare system, get shafted by this country, and nobody in this country gives a f*** about them, whoâs in the leadership. Let me tell you something: I know that those problemsâ¦ the problem in this country, in terms of corruptionâ¦ I know that itâs so deep-seatedâ¦ Itâs taken root over many, many decades, and itâs not going anywhere any time soon. But my HOPEâmy hope in filing this lawsuit was that at least it might be some kind of spark to get things rolling, so that by the time my kids are adults in this society, theyâre not living under an immoral, oligarchic, tyrannical piece-of-shit government that f***ing goes to war in MY name, with my tax dollars, on a perpetual basis and f***ing incinerating people, and I have NO f***ing channel to STOP it. And as an American, I am ashamed. I am ashamed to call myself an American. And let me tell you something else: There were people in Nazi Germany who didnât know what the f*** was going on, eitherâ¦ They were f***ing clueless. They were f***ing brainwashed. And Iâm not making this comparison because of any bullshit comparison between Trump and Nazism thatâs going around that the mainstream media wants you to believe. What Iâm talking about is the REAL government we have in this country. And in my view, they are morally equivalent, or worse, than the government of Nazi Germanyâ¦ Because theyâve been going on longer, and theyâve been f***ing over not just everybody in THIS country, but around the world. And Iâm f***ing sick of it, as a human being.â The dismissal of the DNC voter fraud lawsuit of 2017 will go down in history as a whimper in the annals of unsuccessful movements against the Deep State and its actors. But, perhaps, Beckâs comments will remain as a testament to just how powerful the establishment is, and the lengths to which they will go, including allegedly murdering anyone who gets in their way.",1

The plane was boarded by the FBI and all of the passengers and crew arrested.After hours of tearing the plane apart, Senator Sherman faces charges of running an illegal gambling establishment, possession of cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, ecstasy, and marijuana with intent to distribute and facilitating prostitution. Basically, he was flying around in a private 727 with a bunch of rich Democrats in a mobile den of iniquity.Senator Shermanâs office says they regret the news and expect the Senator to answer questions for himself when heâs done being processed and interrogated. US Attorney Gil Gabriel of the 2nd District of Washington says Sherman should be in front of a judge for a bail hearing tomorrow.Investigators have taken control of the Senatorâs home and office and are now searching for a list of his customers, as the only people on board for the raid were the Senator, three crew members, seven casino workers and a half dozen or so prostitutes â both male and female.Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuch Schumer havenât released official statements, but Pelosi is said to have been especially distraught at the news.They were probably customers.

That same year Lockheed Martin became amember of the Clinton Global Initiative and won 17 contracts from the U.S. StateDepartment, which was led by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Big LeaguePolitics reports.Comey just so happened to have joined the board of the British bank HSBC Holdingsin 2013, which just so happens to be a Clinton Foundation partner.However, one of the most shocking (and important) confiicts of interest of note is this:Comeys brother, Peter Comey, works for the Washington law firm DLA Piper, andserves as its Senior Director of Real Estate Operations for the Americas.So, who is DLA Piper, you ask? Well, DLA Piper happens to be one of the top ten alltimecareer campaign donors for Hillary Clinton. On top of this, DLA Piper alsohappens to do the Clinton Foundations taxes. And if that isnt telling enough, DLAPiper also performed the 2015 audit of the Clinton Foundation when the scandal firstbroke.Per Big League Politics:Property records show that James Comey owns themortgage on his brother Peter Comeys house inVirginia. Therefore, James Comey had a directfinancial relationship with a DLA Piper executive atthe time he was investigating Clinton.These relationships, though egregious, aresymptomatic of the brazen culture of cronycapitalism that exists in our nations capital.

Learn More...The internet is quickly becoming a digital censorship grid, where corporate technological behemoths like Google (who owns YouTube) and Facebook will rig algorithms (which control search engine results and news feeds) to elevate the information they want you to see and bury the information they dont want you to see.Amazon also plays a part in this emerging multinational corporate technological oligarchy, and you may remember they have been caught censoring books in the past (such as No One Died at Sandy Hook by Jim Fetzer) by refusing the book sales on their platform.Declassified documents are tangible and vital pieces of evidence that expose the shocking extent to which groups of people, using and hiding behind the concept of government, have committed egregious crimes against humanity. Its hard for naysayers and censors to deny the authenticity of government declassified files which show our history is full of conspiracy fact, not conspiracy fiction.Declassified Files #1: OperationThink that World War II ended with the defeat of the Nazis?Think again. They didnt get defeated; they just went south (Argentina) and joined the ranks of their conquerors (US, UK, Russia) in a dirty deal of legal immunity for inside information.The German scientists, technicians and engineers had made brilliant and groundbreaking advances in many fields in the leadup to and during the war, and the victors didnt have a moral problem with the Nazi weapons of destruction  the only problem was that the brilliant scientists were on the wrong side.The US got a sizeable portion of these Nazi scientists (around 1500) and smuggled them into NASA and the CIA, where some of them such as Wernher von Braun went on to make a name for themselves. Thus, the US willingly allowed its military and intelligence agencies to be infected with Nazi ideology, which continues to this day.The declassified docs relating to Project Paperclip or Operation Paperclip are here.Declassified Files #2: The Escape of Hitler and Other Nazis to ArgentinaThe mainstream narrative is that at the end of WWII, Hitler committed suicide in Berlin in a bunker. Its a nice story, but apparently, thats all it is  a story.In his book Hitler in Argentina: The Documented Truth of Hitlers Escape from Berlin, author Harry Cooper produced a slew of astounding evidence that Hitler and other top Nazis such as Martin Bormann traveled in German submarines all the way to Argentina.Some of the evidence which supports the truth of this astonishing claim is found in these FBI declassified docs.The article FBI Quietly Declassified Secret Files Attesting Hitler Fled to Argentina in 1945 contains further information.Along with the FBI documents detailing an eye witness account of Hitlers whereabouts in Argentina, more evidence is coming to light to help prove that Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun did not die in that bunker.In 1945, the Naval Attaché in Buenos Aires informed Washington there was a high probability that Hitler and Eva Braun had just arrived in Argentina.This coincides with the sightings of the submarine U-530. Added proof comes in the form of newspaper articles detailing the construction of a Bavarian styled mansion in the foothills of the Andes Mountains.Further proof comes in the form of architect Alejandro Bustillo who wrote about his design and construction of Hitlers new home which was financed by earlier wealthy German immigrants in Argentina.[an] archeologist from Connecticut State, Nicholas Bellatoni was allowed to perform DNA testing on one of the skull fragments recovered from the bunker. What he discovered set off a reaction through the intelligence and scholarly communities.Not only did the DNA not match any recorded samples thought to be Hitlers, they did not match Eva Brauns familiar DNA either.Declassified Files #3: Operation NorthwoodsOperation Northwoods was the outrageous plan for the US military to attack its own people and cities (Washington DC and Miami) as a false flag operation to frame Cuba.It was a pretext to invade Cuba.The 1962 declassified US Joint Chiefs of Staff Memo is entitled Operation Northwoods  Justification for US Military Intervention in Cuba.In its own words, the document states that a series of well coordinated incidents will be planned to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces.Luckily JFK had the nous to reject the plan; by 1962, he had discerned the insidious influence of Military Intelligence Complex upon his presidency.The declassified docs for Operation Northwoods are here.Declassified Files #4: CoIntelProCoIntelPro has become a famous word of its own, derived from the full operational name Counter Intelligence Program. This was a program run by the FBI under Hoover which started in 1956.CoIntelPro was a series of undercover operations that targeted people and groups the US Government deemed were a problem, such as the communist party, other far left groups, civil rights groups, far right groups (e.g. the KKK) and individuals activists such as Martin Luther King.The scope of CoIntelPro was broad: it involved monitoring, surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting and disrupting.Although then Attorney General Robert Kennedy authorized some spying, the FBI was given an inch and took a mile (much like todays spy agencies), clearly overstepping the bounds of legality. It became a way for the government to intimidate and stifle dissidents.Declassified docs on CoIntelPro are here.Declassified Files #5: Operation MockingbirdOperation Mockingbird was a CIA disinformation project to infiltrate and covertly control the mainstream media.It began in the 1950s under then CIA director Allen Dulles.The declassified files (most are classified and secret, but a tiny fraction are here) show how the CIA infiltrated the mainstream media and had its pieces inserted into TV, newspapers and journals everywhere as news when they were nothing more than lies and propaganda.Richard Salant, former President of CBS News, once said that our job is to give people not what they want, but what we decide they ought to have.Mockingbird was famously exposed in the 1975 Church Committee hearings with CIA Director William Colby testifying that over 400 CIA agents were active in the US media, to control what was reported through American mainstream television, newspapers and magazines.Journalists worldwide are still on the payroll, and some were brave enough to talk about it, such as the late Udo Ulfkotte.See Also: Hollywood and The CIA: A Dark Marriage RevealedDeclassified Files #6: Operation MKUltraOperation MKUltra has become so infamous that the term is basically synonymous with mind control. The MK of MKUltra stands for mind kontrolle (German spelling of control), with a nod to the German Nazi scientists who were brought in under Paperclip and developed it for the CIA.In 1953, CIA agent Richard Helms (later CIA director in 1966) chose Dr. Sidney Gottlieb to run the TSS (Technical Service Staff) to develop truth serum drugs, hypnotic techniques and mind control techniques, with the purpose of creating spies, couriers and assassins.Eisenhower approved using Nazi scientists and Jewish victims as guinea pigs. MKUltra was so large it had 149 sub-projects. By 1953, the emphasis of MKUltra was LSD (see below), but by the 1960s, this had changed into biological radio communications.Helms later destroyed much of the MKUltra archive when he left in 1972, but some declassified files remain.Declassified Files #7: Operation Midnight ClimaxOperation Midnight Climax, one of many MKUltra sub-projects, used paid prostitutes to lure people into CIA safe houses in San Francisco, Marin and New York.There, they were surreptitiously given a wide range of substances, including LSD, and monitored behind one-way glass.This was not the first time, nor the last, that the US Government used drugs and other substances with which to experiment upon unsuspecting individuals.The point was to study the effects of LSD and gain research on the potential military and intelligence uses of sexual blackmail, surveillance technology and mind-altering drugs.Some of the declassified files are available here.See also: Declassified Documents Disclose CIA Mind Control ProgramsDeclassified Files #8: CIA Drug SmugglingThe CIA has for many years used illegal drugs to fund its illegal operations. Drugs are often one of the secret motivation behind wars.Vietnam is part of the Golden Triangle of heroin-producing opium poppies, Afghanistan is also home to huge swathes of opium poppies, and after the US invaded many Central and South American countries, it took control of the cocaine production operations there.In 1996, journalist Gary Webb exposed the connection between the CIA, cocaine and the Nicaraguan contras.In the early 1980s, the CIA pushed the sale of cocaine in Los Angeles to help finance their covert war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. (Also see: The Clinton Body Count)You can read some of the declassified files on the CIAs connection to the drug trade here, including excerpts from Oliver Norths notebook obtained under the FOIA.North writes that Air Force General Richard Secord told him (North) that 14 M to finance [the arms in the warehouse] came from drugs.Declassified Files #9: Operation GladioOperation Gladio, which still continues to this day, is the codename for a clandestine NATO stay-behind operation in Italy during the Cold War.The CIA spearheaded Gladio under the pretext of preventing the spread of Soviet communism in Europe.The name gladio is the Italian form of gladius, a type of Roman shortsword.Gladio came to refer to a whole range of stay-behind cells and groups in Europe, although originally, Operation Gladio was the Italian branch.Gladio became famous when then Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti talked about it.Gladio involved the Freemasons, Mafia members and the Vatican, who all united with the CIA and NATO in a holy war against communism.Operation Gladio was responsible for some horrible atrocities and false flag attacks in Italy, such as the bombing of Bologna train station in 1980.Today, even the Western-backed fighters in Nazi Ukraine and Syria are basically Gladio fighters.Declassified files on Gladio can be found here.Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More...Declassified Files #10: Forced Sterilization ProgramsThe United States Government has a long and sordid history of using its own people as guinea pigs and unwitting subjects for experimentation, much of which was done without their knowledge or consent. Some of this came in the form of forced sterilization programs.The article, Forced Sterilization of Native Americans, describes a particular program aimed at Native American Indian women:During the late 1960s and the early 1970s, a policy of involuntary surgical sterilization was imposed upon Native American women in the United States, usually without their knowledge or consent, by the federally funded Indian Health Service (IHS), then run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).It is alleged that the existence of the sterilization program was discovered by members of the American Indian Movement (AIM) during its occupation of the BIA headquarters in 1972.A 1974 study by Women of All Red Nations (WARN), concluded that as many as 42 percent of all American Indian women of childbearing age had, by that point, been sterilized without their consent.A subsequent investigation was conducted by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), though it was restricted to only four of the many IHS facilities nationwide and examined only the years 1973 to 1976.The GAO study showed that 3,406 involuntary sterilizations were performed in these four IHS hospitals during this three-year period. Consequently, the IHS was transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services in 1978.Declassified files are here.Declassified Files #11: Tuskegee Syphilis ExperimentOne of the darkest episodes in the history of the US Government, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment was a nefarious clinical study conducted by the US Public Health Service which began in 1932 and lasted all the way to 1972.The point was to study the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African American men who thought they were receiving free health care from the government.It involved knowingly giving the men syphilis without their knowledge, telling them they just had bad blood, then watching them as the disease progressed. The researchers (or perhaps better put, sadists) deliberately didnt treat the men with penicillin which was found in the 1940s to be an effective cure for syphilis.Meanwhile, numerous men in the study died of syphilis, 40 of their wives contracted the disease and subsequently 19 children were born with congenital syphilis.Declassified files are here.Declassified Files #12: Operation LAC and Operation DewHuman experimentation has not just been limited to the injection of diseases and sterilization.There have also been tests upon the population which have involved spraying entire areas with pathological agents  sometimes natural, sometimes man-made biological warfare agents.Two examples of this are Operation LAC (Large Area Coverage) and Operation Dew, both carried out by the US Army Chemical Corps in the 1950s, both of which involved dispersing tiny zinc cadmium sulfide (ZnCdS) particles (which were fluorescent) and plant spores (lycopodium) from an aircraft over much of the country.The goal was to ascertain the dispersion and geographic range of the sprayed agents.The Government said it was safe at first, but according to the National Library of Medicines TOXNET database, the EPA reported that Cadmium-sulfide was classified as a probable human carcinogen.Some of the declassified files are here.Declassified Files #13: Project SunshineBody snatching and experimentation upon dead bodies (cadavers) is also a documented fact when it comes to governmental crimes.During the 1950s, the US AEC (Atomic Energy Commission) and US Air Force conducted a study on the global health effects of fallout from nuclear weapons testing.The AEC wanted to learn more about how strontium-90 (a radioactive isotope of strontium) affected human tissue and bones, so they secretly collected (stole) over 1500 tissue samples from the bodies of dead babies and young children from around the globe  without consent.Project Sunshine was declassified in 1959.Declassified Files #14: Operation PopeyeAll those who are still skeptical about the reality of chemtrails, cloud seeding and geoengineering programs will want to review this evidence.Operation Popeye was a weather modification program in Southeast Asia (mainly Laos and Vietnam) from 1967 to 1972.The purpose was to aid US efforts in the Vietnam War.Specifically, it was a cloud seeding operation which aimed to extend the monsoon season (targeted over areas of the Ho Chi Minh Trail) by inducing rain over the infiltration routes in North Vietnam and southern Laos and therefore to interdict or at least interfere with truck traffic between North and South Vietnam  as written in this memo from the Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs (Kohler) to Secretary of State Rusk.Chemtrails were also utilized in WWII as a smoke curtain in battle. Check out the footage below:See also: Revealed  US Senate Document Confirms National and Global Weather Modification (Geoengineering) ProgramsDeclassified Files #15: Iran Flight 655The US and Iran have been on tense terms for a long time.In 1953, the US decided to target Iran with one of its now famous regime change programs to overthrow the democratically elected Mossadegh and replace him the puppet dictator Shah who was happy to give the US and UK a cut of the Iranian oil profits.Then, during the Iraq-Iran War of the 1980s, the US took the side of Iraq against Iran.Towards the end of the 1980s (July 3rd, 1988 to be exact), Iran Air Flight 655 (a commercial flight) was travelling along a standard flight path through Iranian airspace on the way to Dubai.Just a few minutes after taking off, it was shot down by the US Navy, killing all 290 people on board.The Navy lied and stated they thought Flight 655 was an attacking fighter plane, and that they had attempted radio contact but received no response.However, declassified documents (here) reveal a different story.The truth was that the US only used emergency radio frequencies but not air traffic control frequencies, and also that the Navy cruiser registered the plane was climbing at the time, not descending as an attacking plane would be. Some of the files were declassified in 1988 and others in 1993.Declassified Files #16: Unit 731This one is another shocking event in the annals of governmental crime, although in the case the perpetrator was the Japanese Government.Unit 731 refers to a covert biological and chemical warfare research and development unit of the Japanese Army located in China during World War II.Under the command of General Ishii, the Japanese committed war crimes and lethal human experimentation upon around 300 people, mostly Chinese victims (though there were some Mongolian, Russian, Korean and Allied POWs too).At the end of the war, the Japanese were caught, but in a familiar tale, the US traded immunity for data (a common theme which also happened with Project Paperclip).The Unit 731 researchers were secretly given immunity by the US in exchange for the data they gathered through human experimentation.Wikipedia quotes Hal Gold on Douglas MacArthur (Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces), who wrote to Washington that, additional data, possibly some statements from Ishii probably can be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information will be retained in intelligence channels and will not be employed as War Crimes evidence.Some of the declassified files are here.Declassified Files #17: Gulf of Tonkin IncidentVietnam was a brutal and devastating war, that changed a generation of young people and forever marred history because it was a war deception and greed, hidden under the veil of patriotism and liberty.LBJ, fresh from his role in the Kennedy assassination, decide to plunge the US into war in 1964 by making shit up.He claimed that the US ships were being fired upon int he Gulf of Tonkin, but it was an utter lie.In 2005 and 2006, NSA documents were declassified showing that the second Gulf of Tonkin incident, which was used as a justification for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (which led to the Vietnam War), never happened.Declassified Files #18: Project StargateProject Stargate was the code name for a secret US Army unit established in 1978 at Fort Meade, Maryland, by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and SRI International (a California contractor).The goal was analyze psychic phenomena (remote viewing, ESP, clairvoyance, astral travel, etc.) and see if they could be weaponized for military and intelligence purposes.The original founders of the program were Russell Targ, Hal Puthoff and Ingo Swann  nicknamed the Psi Spies by the late Jim Marrs.The Project had various predecessors and offshoots (such as Gondola Wish, Grill Flame, Center Lane, Sun Streak and Scanate) until 1991 when they were consolidated and renamed under the umbrella term Stargate Project.At one point, the late Major General Albert Stubblebine was in charge, the same one who was outspoken in exposing the 9/11 false flag operation, and who was the husband of health and nutrition activist Dr. Rima Laibow.The CIA terminated Project Stargate in 1995, deeming that it had provided no use.Find declassified files here.Declassified Files #19: Project 1794Project 1794 is black-and-white proof that the US military, specifically the USAF (US Air Force), was developing UFOs or flying saucers.In 2012, the USAF revealed that its Aeronautical Systems Division had plans to produce a UFO craft in the 1950s.The craft vehicle was designed to reach speeds of Mach 4, an altitude of 100,000 feet and have a range of over 1,000 nautical miles. The project was abandoned in 1961.Find declassified files here.Declassified Files #20: Majestic 12 or MJ-12Majestic 12, also known as MJ-12 or MJ 12, was a shadowy group which was allegedly given the task of overseeing the alien question during the aftermath of WWII, the start of the Cold War and the aftermath of the 1947 UFO Roswell crash.Many researchers and whistleblowers have drawn the conclusion that MJ-12 was the core group within other groups which controlled access to extraterrestrial technology.Some of its members included famous people such as Vannevar Bush, who was also instrumental in the development of weather manipulation programs (as exposed by Peter Kirby in his research on what he calls The New Manhattan Project).Respected UFO researcher Bob Wood (together with his team including son Ryan Wood, UFO researcher Nick Redfern, UFO researcher Stanton Friedman, Timothy Cooper, Jim Clarkson and the late Jim Marrs) has made a website with many Majestic docs available.You can read these MJ-12 files here. They have their own system of rating the documents for authenticity.The document above was authenticated MJ-12 document written by former CIA chief Allen Dulles.References:https://wakeup-world.com/2017/09/21/20-declassified-files-that-prove-government-crime-and-conspiracy/http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/wwii/paperclipcia.pdfhttps://vault.fbi.gov/adolf-hitler/adolf-hitler-part-01-of-04/viewhttp://humansarefree.com/2015/02/fbi-quietly-declassified-secret-files.htmlhttp://tst.greyfalcon.us/bizarre.htmhttp://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/military-intelligence-complex-ex-agents-p1http://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//news/20010430/doc1.pdfhttps://vault.fbi.gov/cointel-prohttp://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/cia/operationmockingbirdCIA.pdfhttps://wakeup-world.com/2015/02/13/hollywood-and-the-cia-a-dark-marriage-revealedhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDCfTIapds0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIaFkR9uriUhttps://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000707674.pdfhttps://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP88-01315R000200070024-3.pdfhttps://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/the-dark-alliance-declassifiedhttp://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/operation-gladiohttp://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/jfk-assassination-who-how-why-part-1http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/category/911-inside-jobhttp://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6242/Forced-Sterilization-of-Native-Americans.htmlhttp://www.gao.gov/assets/120/117355.pdfhttps://catalog.archives.gov/id/281643http://data2.archives.ca/e/e443/e011063033.pdfhttps://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v28/d274http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/dtic/ADA260260.pdfhttps://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reports/2008/R251.pdfhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731https://www.archives.gov/files/iwg/japanese-war-crimes/select-documents.pdfhttps://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/gulf-of-tonkinhttps://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/stargatehttps://catalog.archives.gov/id/6920770http://www.activistpost.com/2017/03/chemtrails-exposed-truly-a-new-manhattan-project.htmlhttp://www.majesticdocuments.comMore Stories Contributed By N.

130,Houston Residents Being Sprayed with Deadly Neurotoxins,no_url,"Houston Residents Being Sprayed with Deadly NeurotoxinsEmigrate While You Still Can! Learn More...Red Alert: HOUSTON OFFICIALS WARN LOCAL RESIDENTS TO USE GAS MASKS AS C-130 GUNSHIPS RAIN DOWN TOXIC SPRAY IN FIGHT AGAINST MOSQUITOS. THE PROBLEM IS, WHAT IF A RESIDENT AND THEIR FAMILY CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY GAS MASKS? WILL THE SAME BE DONE TO PEOPLE IN FLORIDA?A serious situation is developing in Houston as people operating with orders from an unknown source, are spraying a  highly toxic substance, banned in several countries, on the people of of Houston.The authorities are telling the people to don gas masks? Really? What if a family cannot afford gas masks? Also, Houston citizens need to be asking an important question: Are there millions of gas masks available for purchase in Houston?  Further, if there is no other choice. why arent the federal relief funds being used to purchase gas masks for the citizens? And how would these gas masks be distributed?I have handled and worn gas masks before they are difficult to put on and they are even more difficult to remove. What about the elderly or the infirm? What are they to do? What about the children, or infants, what is going to protect them? The spraying of these residents is the best example of depraved indifference that I have ever witnessed.A Slow Burn GenocideIn short America, this is a slow burn genocide for the people of Houston. Now whether this genocide is intentional or an unavoidable tragedy, one can debate the circumstances surrounding this human holocaust. However, there is one unavoidable factor that cannot be debated. The mosquitos which are being sprayed, will not bite and infect all Houston residents, not even close.CONVERSELY, EVERY HOUSTON RESIDENT WILL BE EXPOSED TO THIS BANNED NEUROTOXIN WHICH IS PROVEN TO CAUSE CANCER AND A WHOLE HOST OF COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PROBLEMS.Which is worse, to get sprayed and have a 100% chance of being exposed to life threatening toxins or to do nothing and have a small chance of being bitten by a mosquito, that may or may not be infected with maladies? I would take my chances on being exposed to the mosquitos.Naled to the WallThe neurotoxin that the Air Force is using is called naled, which is in the organophosphate category of insecticides, and the EU banned Naled in 2012 out of concern for ITS EXTREME TOXICITY: The scenarios evaluated in the human health risk assessment as well as in the environmental risk assessment showed a potential and unacceptable risk, wrote the European Commission in its ruling.American health officials disagree. Both the Centers for Disease Control and the US Environmental Protection Agency stand behind naled, stating the small amount of the insecticide sprayed from planes doesnt expose people enough to pose a health concern. Please allow me to don my Common Sense hat. Watch the following and ask yourself if this looks like a small amount of neurotoxin being sprayed upon the residents of Houston,  to you?What does your Common Sense tell you? Does this look like a small amount or are you, like myself, beginning to have doubts about the story the Air Force and the EPA are telling the news media?Additionally, the Air Force stated, in a press release, saying the insecticide will be used in volumes the EPA considers safe. Bravo Sierra! Isnt that what the soldiers were told who were exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam, or Corexit in the Gulf following the Gulf oil spill? Who do they think they are kidding?The neurotoxin, in question, caused the Governor of Puerto Rico to call out the army and prevent its distribution in a similar situation. Texas Governor Abbott needs to do the same thing for his people and the mayor of Houston needs to be driven from office for gross negligence and depraved indifference.Texas Governor Abbott is a good man. He needs to step up and do what the Governor of Puerto Rico did to protect his people from the insane Deep State and I would bet my bottom dollar that this is where this is coming from.Meanwhile, my advice to the good people of Houston is to leave the area, at least for the short-term.",1

Thats 4 more than Michelle Obama,and 2 more than Jacky Kennedy, who used her knowledge of French and Italian tohelp JFK negotiate with leaders across the Globe.Melania knows Serbian, Slovenian, German, French, and English. She knows a bit ofa lot of di??erent languages.From the Week:She grew up in communist Yugoslavia and speaks ??ve languagesSlovene, English, French, Serbian and German, if you want to know. That linguisticprowess could come in handy at White House functions, but it has been suggestedher thick accent is the reason she makes few public speeches alongside herimmigrant-bashing husband.Melania was raised away from the glamour of New York high society in a concretetower block in then Yugoslavia during the rule of Marshal Josip Tito. Now that herhusband has become president, Melania is the ??rst ??rst lady to be born in acommunist nation and only the second to be born abroad, after Louisa Adams, theEnglish wife of sixth president John Quincy, who served from 1825 to 1829.Her native Slovenia wants to help the USs relationship with RussiaMelanias home country appears to believe her rise to the White House could be anopportunity to increase its own standing in the world. Tiny Slovenia, with itspopulation of two million, has positioned itself as a possible mediator between theUS and Russia.Russian President Vladimir Putin, who rarely makes trips to western states, hasvisited Slovenia twice and the two nations have a comfortable relationship withone another.Prime Minister Miro Cerar told the Associated Press last year: If the United Statesand Russia give some initiative in this way, Slovenia could become a bridge between the two powers.Donalds apparent soft spot for Russia may mean Slovenias services are notrequired. However, Cerar said he had spoken to Melania in a phone call followingthe Trump election victory, both chatting in their native tongue.Intel scholars have proven her IQ is the highest based on her self made fortune andher knowledge of many languages.Shes also the best looking first lady in history.",1
132,Obama Sent MILLIONS Of Dollars To Fund A Terrorist Group,no_url,"First of all, he didnât wait long after his inauguration to send our troops in Iraq. This enabled Iran to take over Iraq. This cost us500 American soldiers.While he was at it, his Secretaries of State, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, helped him to create a negotiation platform directly with Iran.According to former CIA Analyst Fred in Obamabomb, âA Dangerous and Growing National Security Fraud, the nuclear deal with Iran and the Obama administrationâs defense of it are full of deceptions and dishonesty.âThen we had false narratives to the media that saluted the disturbing deal they made. And as if that wasnât enough,the Obama Administration provided $150 BILLION in sanctions relief directly to Iran! Yet they failed to mention to Iran that they attempted to gain nuclear bomb capabilities.After that, on January 17th, 2016, Obama sent $400 million by an unmarked cargo plane. The money was sent as an exchange for four Americans being held captive by Iran. But, the deal didnât stop here. Obama also released seven Iranian terrorists that were being held captive by the U.S.Oh, oh, and letâs not forget the$1.3 BILLION he sent to Iran, JUST BECAUSE! Guys, this lunatic led our country for 8 years! Glad thatâs over!But, the story doesnât end hereâ¦ A report released by Jewish News Service Yeshiva explains exactly where that sum ended. Get ready for this: the money was sent to a terrorist group, Hezbollah.Ðs Jewish News Service Yeshiva reports:According to a Saudi Arabian newspaper report on April 25th, Hezbollah had received $600 million worth of Iranian aid. The Al-Youm newspaper reported that the aid was transferred almost completely in hard cash, and is being used for the terror groupâs institutions and salaries paid to its terrorists and their families.Hezbollah is a terrorist organization that is headed by Hassan Nasrallah, its Secretary general. It was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israelis who had entered Lebanon to increase stability in the north. Its leaders were followers of Ayatollah Khomeini, and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 Revolutionary Guards that arrived from Iran with permission from the Syrian government, which was in occupation of Lebanon at the time.Hezbollah receives money from several sources including monies received from Shiite businessmen abroad, charity taxes, profit from Shiite websites in Iraq; and money received from Shiite imams in Iraq and abroad.Arenât you glad that Hillary didnât win? Imagine what would have kept on going! Imagine how much more money would have been sent to fund other terrorist groups!",1
133,3 Liberal Celebrities Arrested For Conspiracy To Assassinate President Trump,https://worldpoliticsnow.com/2017/04/breaking-3-liberal-celebrities-arrested-for-conspiracy-to-assassinate-president-trump/,"Liberals have been going nuts ever since their hero, the criminal Hillary Clinton, lost the election. They just canât believe that Donald trump, a man who stole the hearts of a huge majority of Americans, won in such a landslide. Even though the people have spoken, liberals think they should get their way. Their heroes, a bunch of tree-hugging Hollywood celebrities, have been leading that charge whenever possible.This morning, new details came out that are shocking even to conservatives. The Secret Service has arrested three liberal celebrities in an apparent conspiracy to assassinate the president. You heard that right. They arenât protesting and they didnât just make threats, they were actually conspiring to kill President Trump.Special Agent Lucas Kimball, head of the Secret Service task force on credible threats against the president, told Breitbart:âThis was a real plan to not only murder a sitting president but to take half a building and most likely a lot of other innocent lives with him. We were surprised that these three people were capable of such evil thoughts. They insist that they will be remembered by history as the people who tried to âstop the next Hitler.ââLiberalism is, in fact, a mental disorder. The three liberals were arrested as enemy combatants and brought to a military base due to the threat of mass destruction by means that are being called domestic terrorism. The Secret Service turned them over to CIA interrogators and werenât going to release their names, but after just a few minutes of enhanced interrogation, all three cracked and gave up anyone involved.The three to be charged with terrorist threats, conspiracy to commit murder and treason are Actors Seth Rogan and James Franco and singer/songwriter Miley Cyrus. All three will be arraigned in federal court Monday morning. They implicated more than a dozen others who will face conspiracy charges but those names arenât being released until theyâve been picked up and interrogated themselves to see just how far this thing goes.Jeff Derpinger, from the White House Office of Information and Propaganda, says the president is safely sheltered in place for now until the threat has been neutralized.",1

While setting up his tree stand just outside a wildlife reserve in Montana, Nugent was fired on and hit in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear.Details are still coming out, but apparently Nugent often hunts this are for animals that stray from the preserve. He was just setting up before dawn without any reflective or hunterâs orange visible, wearing a fur hat he would typically change for a camo and orange version once the sun came up.The hunter who shot him faces manslaughter charges as the shot rang out and was recorded by a local game warden a full 15 minutes before dawn, which is the legal start of the day for hunting. The identity of the hunter hasnât been released. He was arrested and booked at the State Police barracks in Boseman. Nugentâs family has been notified.Please send your thoughts and prayers to Tedâs family and friends in this trying time.",1

Prior to admitting the problem believed to have been caused by illegal aliens in the area, fifteen people died and a whopping 400 are hospitalized.California is one state which has led the charge against President Donald Trumpâs crackdown on immigration, by deliberately giving illegals a âsanctuaryâ to escape to after crossing the southern border into the United States.With that as their priority, they inadvertently invited in much more than a flood of new residents, which Trump had warned about. San Diego did things their way and now are suffering the horrific cost of that detrimental decision.As many Americans were packing up for the long weekend to celebrate the final holiday of the summer, officials in SanDiegoo were dealing with a devastating issue. Rather than heading to the beach or other relaxing location, residents were flooding hospitals in droves, suffering from what quickly became a complete health crisis in the area.According to Fox News, âThe liver disease outbreak started last November, with the homeless population affected most. The emergency declaration will help the city access state funds and provide legal protection for new sanitation measures, the Union-Tribune reported.ââAreas with high concentrations of homeless people will receive roughly 40 portable hand-washing stations to help combat the disease, which can spread through fecal matter when people fail to thoroughly clean their hands after using the restroom.â",1
136,Sharyl Attkisson: It Looks Like Obama Did Spy on Trump Just Like He Apparently Did to Me,no_url,"Investigative journalist, Sharyl Attkisson was one of the many people targeted by the Obama administration for surveillance.Her personal computer and CBS laptop were hacked after she began filing stories about Benghazi that were unflattering to the Obama administration. Attkisson wrote a New York Times bestseller documenting this called Stonewalled.On Wednesday, Attkisson wrote an Op-Ed for The Hill titled, It looks like Obama did spy on Trump, just as he apparently did to me in response to the CNN report that Obamas FBI indeed wiretapped Trumps former campaign manager Paul Manafort.Attkisson said in her op-ed that many in the media are missing the bigger story with the wiretapping reports. The Obama administration spied on political opponents, journalists and members of Congress and asks if the intel agencies are indeed weaponized.She also points out a pattern that every time CIA Director John Brennan or DNI head James Clapper were caught spying, they would falsely deny such accusations.Attkisson points out that the media is happy to push propaganda for the government rather than report the truth:Then, as now, instead of getting the bigger story, some in the news media and quasi-news media published false and misleading narratives pushed by government interests. They implied the computer intrusions were the stuff of vivid imagination, conveniently dismissed forensic evidence from three independent examinations that they didnt review.Attkisson concludes:Officials involved in the surveillance and unmasking of U.S. citizens have said their actions were legal and not politically motivated. And there are certainly legitimate areas of inquiry to be made by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But look at the patterns. It seems that government monitoring of journalists, members of Congress and political enemies  under multiple administrations  has become more common than anyone would have imagined two decades ago. So has the unmasking of sensitive and highly protected names by political officials.Read the full op-ed here.Attkisson also posted her Obama-era surveillance timeline which is bone chilling to read.In the timeline, Attkisson reveals when she began to be targeted by the Obama admin and how it progressed.It looks like Obama did spy on Trump, just as he apparently did to me https://t.co/o6Vjl3TVbF Sharyl Attkisson (@SharylAttkisson) September 20, 2017",1

Its UNBELIEVABLE or PREDICTABLE depending on present company.According to CNN:US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia meddling probe.The liberal media is shrieking in an attempt to turn the story against Trump by being shocked at the fact a candidate would be spied upon. Totally forgetting the fact that they have spent months spinning the fact that no surveillance ever took place.So many questions. Was Manafort cooperating to hurt Trump? Why was a FISA warrant issued and who signed off on it?CNN Continues:It is unclear when the new warrant started. The FBI interest deepened last fall because of intercepted communications between Manafort and suspected Russian operatives, and among the Russians themselves, that reignited their interest in Manafort, the sources told CNN. As part of the FISA warrant, CNN has learned that earlier this year, the FBI conducted a search of a storage facility belonging to Manafort. Its not known what they found.The plot thickens. Stay tuned to see where this twist of events leads.Blood is in the waterno one can tell yet just whose it is. Only time will tell.",1

Shortly after Chelsea showed up to say goodbye and Bill was spotted on his front porch with a Bloody Mary, the crowd was informed that Clinton had taken her last breath and began cheering.They carried signs that said âLock her upâ¦in Hell!â and âSend her straight to Satan!â People certainly do have contempt for the woman. Clintonâs doctor said that while she wasnât there long, her condition and death were âdrawn out and excruciating.â Basically, she died the same way the people sheâs murdered over the years did.Hopefully she felt completely helpless as her third death in as many weeks makes its way across social media with the majority of people choosing not to believe it. Unfortunately, fake news has gotten so bad that conservatives like us, who tend to have a lower IQ and education level but better jobs than liberals, tend to believe what we want to believe.President Trump couldnât be reached for comment, as he is currently engaged in diplomatic relations on the back nine in Camden.

140,Obama Spied On Trump! One Of The Few Real Journalists Shares Her Experience With Wiretapping!,https://www.usapoliticstoday.com/attkisson-obama-wiretapping-trump/,"Most of the mainstream press is obsessed with attempting to cover ex â President Barack Obama and his employees that spied on many people doing work for Donald Trump campaign, however, not everyone. One reporter who still knows what her occupation should really be about is Sharyl Attkisson.In the Hill, Attkisson has a brand-new op-ed showing off the âbigger storyâ her colleagues tend to be ignoring. The way the Obama Administrationâs acted symbolized the âweaponization of intel organizations.âShe notices that Team Trump is not really the first focus of the earlier administration, that secretly spied Congress associates during the Iran nuclear offer discussions, wiretapped inspection journalists in 2010, spied on Rep. Dennis Kucinich, and wiretapped Senate staffers in 2014.Attkisson ought to know â she had been one of the objectives:The government consequently got caught tracking journalists at Fox, The Associated Press, and, when i claim in a federal legal action, my computer systems while I functioned as an correspondent at CBS.After that, as right now, instead of obtaining the bigger report, some within the news media as well as quasi-news press published fake and deceptive narratives pressed by federal government interests. These people implied the PC intrusions had been the things of brilliant imagination. They easily ignored forensic proof coming from three independent assessments which they didnât overview. All were happy to let information of the governmentâs illegal behavior disappear, rather than reach the truth.Sharyl Attkisson fights hard to prove wiretapping on herself and Trump by the Obama administration.I have invested more than 2 yrs. litigating up against the Department of Justice for that computer attacks. Forensics have exposed dates as well as methods of a few of the illegal actions. The software utilized was exclusive to a government intel organization. The criminals used the keystroke checking program. They hacked the business computer system, wiretapped my chats through actual computerâs mic and used Skype to steal files.We made it through the governmentâs latest try to dismiss the lawsuit. There is yet another hearing Friday. Till now, the Trump DOJ like the Obama DOJ is battling within court to keep hidden the identities.Attkisson continues to lay out the government constant expansion regarding its questionable spying endeavors in recent years, beginning with year 2011 growth of its power to wiretap on Americans, resulting in shocking 30, 000 US residents wiretapped in 2016. This is a (extreme surge from 9, 500 in 2013), and the NSA acknowledging shortly prior to the 2016 political election to breaking privacy rights âwith much larger frequencyâ compared to previously recognized.Officials responsible for the wiretapping of US citizens are positive their activities were lawful and not criminally motivated. But consider the patterns. The governmentâs wiretapping of journalists, members in Congress as well as political foes is becoming more common. Nobody thought of this 20 years ago. Therefore, has the âsharingâof delicate and extremely guarded names by politics officials.This really is larger than Donald Trump or Barack Obama.

141,Hillary Clinton Was Caught Giving $800.00 To Fund Antifa!!,http://freshdaily.news/hillary-clinton-was-caught-giving-800-00-to-fund-antifa/,"Hillary plagued by scandals as she never learned her lesson. This woman was caught in a domestic terrorist funding scheme. It was pretty clear to all of us that Soros and his cohorts control the Antifa, we saw the Antifa paychecks and we witness that all pro-socialist oriented groups use the same narrative and have the same attitude, but nobody expected that the sore loser Hillary is still involved is flash mobs and domestic terrorism.Read more below:We couldnât make this kind of stuff up if we tried. Hillary Clintonâs corrupt behavior has her in hot water again. She failed miserably at brainwashing the masses of Americans that she attempted to during the 2016 Presidential Election, and now she has done something that really has Americans turning their backs on her for good. Federal Election Commission filings have proven that Hillary Clinton has given $800,000 from her personal campaign funds to her new political action group, Onward Together.The Daily Caller explained that Clintonâs âdark moneyâ group received the $800,000 directly from her 2016 failed presidential campaign. This was right before the group launched back in May.There is a huge catch. Offended America has reported that the money actually went to the terrorist organization, Antifa. Clinton is backing up these âresistanceâ groups like Antifa that are simply local terrorist organizations. During the 2016 Presidential Election, Clinton was caught criticizing all dark money groups. Ironically enough, now she has her very own.After Hillary Clintonâs epic fail in the 2016 Presidential Election, it seemed quite obvious that her power was becoming limited. This is a woman who had made her entire living taking monetary donations from other corrupt people. It might have been her descent into irrelevance that pushed her to make the decision to form her own super-PAC. Whatever it was, she did.There were doubts that Clintonâs PAC was even making use of all the donation money they had received, but the Daily Caller spoke to five separate Antifa affiliated groups. Only one of these groups actually denied donations from Clintonâs group, Onward Together. A Soros-linked group, called Indivisible, did deny any financial gain from Clinton or her group, Onward Together.Clinton had explained that her intention was for Onward Together to be âpart of the resistance.â Her intentions are clear. She is trying to counter President Donald Trump with violent action and protests. The groupâs mission statement even says that they are working towards âencouraging people to organize, get involved, and run for office.â They are hoping to push âprogressive values and work to build a brighter future for generations to come.âThis woman doesnât even deny her involvement with such groups. Clinton actually signed an email, which was sent out last week, that requests money. She wrote âyou may not have heard much about the work weâre doing at Onward Together. Thatâs because weâre working behind the scene to fund, support, and amplify the work of the groups weâre supporting. Weâre not the story: they are.âIt still baffles me how more than 65 million people voted for a CAREER CRIMINAL like Hillary Clinton. We really dodged a bullet during last yearâs election cycle.Hillary Clinton has a good chance to leave the USA, go on some island in the third world countries and stay there until the rest of the days living a luxurious life. Thatâs the best possible scenario for her and her equally, if not worse, corrupted husband.As long as she continues to be involved in scandals like this, sheâs getting closer to where she really belongs-jailhouse.",1

143,"CDC Proposes Rule to Apprehend and Detain anyone, anywhere, at any time, for any duration, without Due Process or right of Appeal - and administer FORCED Vaccinations!",http://www.redflagnews.com/headlines-2016/cdc-proposes-rule-to-apprehend-and-detain-anyone-anywhere-at-any-time-for-any-duration-without-due-process-or-right-of-appeal-and-administer-forced-vaccinations,"The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has proposed a ""rule"" giving them the power to apprehend and detain anyone, anywhere, at any time, without Due Process or any right of appeal, and to hold that person in quarantine for as long as the CDC wants -- and no one can refuse them!   Editor's Opinion:  This is the kind of tyranny that the Second Amendment is designed to protect Americans from.Based on CDC's 8/15/16 publication of  ' Rules for the Control of Communicable Diseases', the CDC is giving itself the power to forcibly apprehend healthy people  en masse, and detain them indefinitely with no process of appeal.Kindly enough the CDC is giving the public until 10/14/2016 to comment on its new found extra-Constitutional power,""and whether there are any public concerns with the absence of a specific maximum apprehension period in the regulation.""Of course and as would be expected from a totalitarian unconstitutional power grab,""When an apprehension occurs, the individual is not free to leave or discontinue his/her discussion with an HHS/CDC public health or quarantine officer.""Moreover, the CDC also would like the public's input on the fact their power is not limited to just individual persons but rather they could apprehend entire cities in mass if they so desired:""HHS/CDC specifically requests public comment on this proposed provision to issue Federal orders to entire groups rather than individuals.""And as is to be expected since its impossible to give a medical examine to an entire city, the CDC would also like your comments on the fact""the proposed practice to issue Federal orders before a medical examination has taken place. ""For those wishing to give the CDC their requested comments on their new found powers, the link to make such comments can be found under the SOURCE links at the end of this article. Anyone who is interested would do well to read the CDC's entire publication in the Federal Register.The CDC's claimed power follows these Stages:You (or your city) are declared ""precommunicable""Apprehension and Detention [A&D]Order of Isolation, Quarantine, or Conditional ReleaseIn stage 1:""CDC defines precommunicable stage to mean the stage beginning upon an individual's earliest opportunity for exposure to an infectious agent"",as previously indicated CDC does NOT need to give a medical exam to declare you (or your city) ""precommunicable"". In fact, you may be perfectly healthy, unexposed, and uninfected. All that is required is for someone to say they suspect you (or your city) had a nebulous general and poorly defined ""opportunity"" for exposure.Moreover, you don't even get any due process to prove you had zero opportunity to be exposed until after CDC has proceeded on to Stage 3; The rub being the CDC can hold you (or your city) at Stage 2 indefinitely with no appeal by never proceeding to Stage 3. ie Do Not Pass Go, Go Directly To Jail.In Stage 2:CDC sneaks in its unlimited and unchecked authority. They've couched this authority by describing how they ""generally"" expect it to work in a temporary manner, but they've also clearly stated it is open ended and there is no discussion of due process in the A&D phase (again CDC wants your comments on this fact).To see how CDC's concept of unlimited city wide Apprehension and Detention would play out, watch CDC's very own 2011 propaganda movieContagion. A movie basically written for and by the CDC to scare the public into funding them and showcase how their heroic dream response to an outbreak would unfold.There is no onus on the CDC to end the Apprehension phase, or to proceed on to issuing orders of isolation, quarantine, or conditional release; As such you (or your city) can be held in apprehension and detention indefinitely.In Stage 3:IF an order of isolation, quarantine, or conditional release is issued, the CDC gives those so ordered one chance in the first 72 hours to ask CDC to change their minds, after which unlimited detention is again on the table.The CDC can stop, detain, and jail you anywhere.The other key factors of note is that the CDC does NOT limit this power to the international borders. CDC says it can take such actions any where in the USA based on a claim that every action affects interstate travel.CDC claims it can set up check points at any bus or train station in the country, or at any location that might affect interstate travel.CDC claims that the simple act of lining up at any CDC checkpoint gives them irrevocable authority to force you to be screened. ""an individual's refusal to be screened may result in quarantine, isolation, or conditional release"" This could be in your car stuck in traffic at a CDC check point, a bus station, a taxi-stand, etc etc.""(holding that a passenger consents to an airport security search by presenting himself/herself for boarding and that such consent may not be revoked by simply walking away). Thus, in order to protect interstate travel from communicable disease threats, HHS/CDC intends for this section to apply broadly to all circumstances where individuals may queue with other travelers""""HHS/CDC believes that the rationale for airport security screenings may be extended to other forms of transportation, e.g., trains and buses, because of the similar administrative or special governmental need in preventing interstate communicable disease spread""FORCED VACCINATION""CDC may enter into an agreement with an individual, upon such terms as the CDC considers to be reasonably necessary, indicating that the individual consents to any of the public health measures authorized under this part, including quarantine, isolation, conditional release, medical examination, hospitalization, vaccination, and treatment; provided that the individual's consent shall not be considered as a prerequisite to any exercise of any authority under this part.""Even though the CDC believes it can force all the above procedures on individuals and groups, it also uses ""voluntary agreements"" for the sole purpose of making forced actions easier to perform. Anyone breaking these ""voluntary agreements"", even if they didn't agree to them, is subject to criminal prosecution.""individuals who violate the terms of the agreement or the terms of the Federal order for quarantine, isolation, or conditional release (even if no agreement is in place between the individual and the government), he or she may be subject to criminal penalties""Surprisingly, the one thing CDC's left out of this rule making is the creation of the their own armed Federal Police Force to carry out these action; but it can't be far off.This is simple:  If any agency of any government tries to stop innocent, healthy people, without cause, without warrant and without charge, then tries to detain, quarantine or imprison you,  then what they are doing is unlawful denial of Constitutional rights and you have just grounds to SHOOT THEM.  If you choose to shoot, make certain you SHOOT FIRST and SHOOT TO KILL.",1

Some claim he is a Muslim, a terrorist or a Russian spy. However, what is known beyond any reasonable doubt is that he is largely incompetent and has little love for America.Proof of this can be found by looking no further that the White House logo, which was redesigned in 2016.Everyone known what the White House logo is supposed to look like  a portrait of the North Face of the White House  but what few people have noticed over the past few years was the change at the top of the logo.For many years, the White House logo had the American flag flying on the top of the White House  as it does in real life. In Obamas redesigned version, there is no American flag, just a white flag.Here is what the original logo looked like:And here is Obamas sanitized version:The white flag is a common symbol for surrender, which has many people wondering if Obama was trying to secretly signal to Americas enemies that he was surrendering.In all seriousness, this probably wasnt some secret signal. It was just Obama disrespecting America and trying to get rid of anything that made us special  which really shouldnt surprise anyone at this point.Obama has disgraced the American flag multiple times while in office, so it should be no surprise that he would completely remove it from the White House logo.Weve suffered for almost eight years under a president who has made it clear he doesnt think America is special. We desperately need to elect someone who will restore our faith in our country and put America, and Americans, first.H/T WZ",1

The FBI Director's announcement that the Bureau had found more emails pertinent to its Hillary Clinton private e-mail server investigation, and was re-opening that investigation, sent shockwaves across the political spectrum this afternoon.The fact that the FBI made such an announcement is extraordinary in itself.  Generally, the Bureau does NOT publicly reveal that someone is under investigation, never mind someone who is so high-profile, like an active candidate for President!  So the revelation that the Hillary investigation is now re-opened is an absolute stunner on many levels.  Frankly, all experts agree that it must be something extraordinary they found; something likely criminal.Adding to the drama was that the FBI Director did NOT coordinate the announcement with the White House or with the Department of Justice (DOJ) - which could be an effort by the Bureau to regain its lost reputation for Integrity.  Keeping the White house and Justice Department out of the loop means they could not interfere prior to the announcement, and now that the announcement has been made publicly, neither the White House nor the DOJ can prevent the public from knowing something big is taking place.""DEVASTATING REVELATIONS""And ""big"" might be an understatement.  Late Friday night, the White House very quietly CANCELED all of Barack Obama's scheduled campaign appearances on behalf of Hillary Clinton!  The scheduled events, confirmed for months, were all quietly DELETED.  See the Before and After images below:Whatever information the FBI has found must be completely devastating for Clinton.  So devastating, that President Obama can no longer even be seen as supporting her candidacy!This FBI announcement has ""criminality"" written all over it.Stay tuned.",1

Veterans cannot make appointments, the cost for treatment is outrageous, over 307,000 veterans diedwaiting for care, yet nobody has been held accountable. The most recent atrocity by the VA came when the VA went to Congress, less than three months before the end of the fiscal year,short $2.6 billion in funds in order to care for the veterans.The Secretary of Veteran Affairs, Robert McDonald, told Congress that if they do not receive $2.6 billion more in funds, they will have to deny veterans the care they deserve. The VA hasbeen known to delay doctor appointments, especially in the past 7 years. Robert McDonald has only been Secretary of Veteran Affairs for the past year, yet he has already made somehorrific things. What youre seeing is a sea of change in the way VA operates. Historically, weve managed to a budget instead of managing to requirements based on veterans needs.After discussing the possibility of closing some of the VA hospitals, Congress passed an emergency spending bill worth $3.5 billion. Josh Earnest, White House spokesman, said that theUnited States has committed to spend $4.5 billion in order to help rebuild Syria while also addressing the refugee camps scattered throughout Europe. $419 million will be designated forhumanitarian aid assisting with Syrian refugees. The money is coming from the United States Agency for International Development which means that Congress will not get the chance to denythe funding.While thousands of veterans are dying waiting for medical care and even more are living on the streets, the United States is sending over several billion dollars to help other countries.The United States cant even take care of those who protect its freedom, yet the Obama Administration doesnt seem to notice or care.",1
147,California Introduces Law To Jail Anyone Who Questions Man-Made Climate Change: First Amendment Now Dead,http://www.redflagnews.com/headlines-2016/california-introduces-law-to-jail-anyone-who-questions-man-made-climate-change-first-amendment-now-dead,"A landmark bill allowing for the prosecution of climate change dissent effectively died Thursday after the California Senate failed to take it up before the deadline.Senate Bill 1161, or the California Climate Science Truth and Accountability Act of 2016, would have authorized prosecutors to sue fossil fuel companies, think tanks and others that havedeceived or misled the public on the risks of climate change.The measure, which cleared two Senate committees, provided a four-year window in the statute of limitations on violations of the states Unfair Competition Law, allowing legal action to bebrought until Jan. 1 on charges of climate change fraud extending back indefinitely.This bill explicitly authorizes district attorneys and the Attorney General to pursue UCL claims alleging that a business or organization has directly or indirectly engaged in unfaircompetition with respect to scientific evidence regarding the existence, extent, or current or future impacts of anthropogenic induced climate change, said the state Senate RulesCommittees floor analysis of the bill.Leading the fight against the measure was the Civil Justice Association of California, joined by pro-business groups such as the California Chamber of Commerce and the California BusinessRoundtable.Justice association President Kim Stone said she was pleased that the state Senate realized this bill was extreme.Our concern about the bill is that by eliminating the statute of limitations and reviving claims from forever in the past, its fundamentally unfair, said Ms. Stone.The statute of limitations under the Unfair Competition Law is now four years. As originally introduced, the bill would have allowed climate fraud lawsuits extending back 30 years, butlater was amended to provide no time limit, she said.This bill would be as if the IRS now said that we could audit you for the first year you filed your taxes, or your parents taxes, or even for your grandparents taxes. Would you have thedocumentation required to defend yourself if you were accused of having done something wrong? Ms. Stone said. No, nobody would have saved their papers because everyone knows the IRS hasthree years to audit you.The measure was introduced amid a national push by Democrats and activist groups to use the legal system to prosecute climate change fraud, prompting a backlash from skeptics who havedenounced the campaign as an assault on free speech.A coalition of 17 state attorneys general, including California Attorney General Kamala Harris, have joined forces to pursue climate change skeptics. At least four prosecutors reportedlyhave launched investigations into Exxon Mobil for climate change fraud.Introduced by state Sen. Ben Allen, Santa Monica Democrat, S.B. 1161 had strong support from environmental groups, led by the Union of Concerned Scientists.The group, which had no immediate comment on the bills failure, had argued that the measure was needed to challenge efforts to confuse consumers and fend off competition from lower-carbonenergy sources.To be clear, S.B. 1161 does not presume that any fossil fuel company has violated the law. But should the evidence support legal action, S.B. 1161 will give public prosecutors a morepowerful tool to pursue it, Jason Barbose, Western states policy manager of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a May 16 post.It would be an unfortunate contortion of our justice system for a fossil fuel company to escape prosecution for unlawful acts simply because it successfully hid the evidence from publicview. S.B. 1161 protects the public from such a risk, he said.",1
148,Wikileaks Massive Exposure: Here Are 6 Republicans Who Took Bribes From Clinton To âDestroy Trumpâ,http://americanprides.com/2017/08/24/wikileaks-massive-exposure-here-are-6-republicans-who-took-bribes-from-clinton-to-destroy-trump/,"Hillary Clinton is still whining about her humiliating loss to President Donald Trump in last yearâs election. She plans to take him down and her plan involves some powerful Republicans. Wikileaks named Paul Ryan, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain as Republicans who were paid off by Clinton to ensure that Donald Trump lost the election, or undermine him if he won as reported by Conservative Daily Post. Her evil plot was revealed in an email sent last July from Clintonâs campaign manager John Podesta to top aide Huma Abedin. Podesta detailed how the funds were being redirected from Clintonâs campaign to the Super PACs of Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, and Jeb Bush. âJB, CF, and JK PACS will be noticeably silent for the rest of the campaign.â The email continued, âEach will receive a significant allowance from advertising budget. HRC is in the loop and has talked to all three personally. Eyes only.â As revealed in other emails, several members of the Republican Party were bought off in order to push the Clinton agenda forward. Only one day before Speaker of the House Paul Ryan retracted Donald Trumpâs invitation to speak at an event in Wisconsin, an email was sent out that could be to blame. It read, âHe is on board, will retract the invitation to speak. Eyes only.â Other Clinton emails imply that money is being moved to Republican elected officials in the House and Senate. For example, right after John McCain attacked President Trump by publicly criticizing him, FEC records show that two large donations from PACS and private sources went to the senator immediately after.",1

According to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Gomez was able to provide âplenty of informationâ to aid in the investigation into Riceâs abuse of her power in the Obama administration to âunmaskâ of people associated with Donald Trump in an effort to swing the election in favor of a certain âcrookedâ opponent of his.On Tuesday evening, Gomezâs lifeless body was found floating in Lake Hope, just outside of her hometown of Ithica, Connecticut. Police officers took some time to identify the body because her finger tips had been severed and no family was immediately able to identify her, but her identity was determined via dental records from Dr. Michael Armstrong, DDS.There are currently no suspects in the murder, but Police Captain Ari Reynolds says that they are âpursuing this case with the appropriate amount of manpower.âWhen the murderer is caught, he or she will talk.

Itâs as if she was Rip Van Winkle has been asleep since the Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative had been functioning. If we are concerned about foreign government money in our politics as Hillary Clinton says she is letâs begin with the Clinton Foundation and begin with a very basic simple premise that is the Clinton Foundation agreed, signed an agreement with Barack Obama that they would disclose all of their donors on an annual basis.Under oath Hillary Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the same thing and we know they havenât done it, that there are at least 1,100 foreign donations that they have any been disclosed to the American public. I was just shaking my head throughout that speech. It was. remarkable for her to say that.âDiscussing the Clinton Foundation receiving $145 million from the shareholders of Uranium One, he continued, âLook there are couple of things that are extremely troubling about the deal we touched on. number one is the amount of money $145 million. We are not talking about a super PAC giving a million dollars to support a candidate. We are not talking about campaign donations. We are talking about $145 million which by the way is 75 percent or more of the annual budget of the Clinton Foundation itself so itâs a huge sum of money. Second of all we are talking about a fundamental issue of national security which is uranium â itâs not like oil and gas that you can find all sorts of places.There are precious few places you can mine for uranium, in the United States is one of those areas. And number three we are talking about the Russian government. A lot of people donât realize it now, in parts of the Midwest American soil is owned by Vladimir Putinâs government because this deal went through.And in addition to the $145 million Bill Clinton got half a billion dollars, $500,000 for a 20-minute speech from a Russian investment bank tied to the Kremlin, two months before the State Department signed off on this deal. It just stinks to high heaven and I think it requires a major investigation by the federal government.âHe added, âEveryone knows the reason that money flows to politicians is people want something in return. And particularly when you are talking about overseas in places like Nigeria or Russia or the United Arab Emirates. Those political cultures are rife with pay off and corruption.And to think that you have got a Nigerian businessmen pledging $1 billion with a B to the Clinton Global Initiative that he wants nothing from the Clinton in return is just laughable. I think the American people recognize that there is a pay to play  system in Washington and thatâs why you are seeing this rebellion against money in politics.âCROOKED Hillary Clinton never made a clean deal.Thank God, we the people elected Trump.

157,Do You Support Trump In Canceling Funding For Obamaâs Free House And Library ?,http://lahrennews.com/support-trump-canceling-funding-obamas-free-house-library-click-vote/,"Donald Trump continues to buck the establishmentâs system by doing things the way he wants them done. After learning that President Obama ordered the Department of Educationâs library division to divert more than $8 million in funds to a fund to build the next Presidential Library, Trump wrote the order rescinding it and putting the money into improving the education of privately held charter schools instead.Michelle Obama, who was going to get a free home on the top floor of the new building that was rumored to be a replica of the White House Residence, was reportedly so upset at the news that she canceled her plans to attend the annual Kumonawanna pig roast in Honolulu.Obama will have no recourse but to try to raise the money or pay for the project himself, but without the big donors and connections of a great Republican president, heâll probably be stuck buying something that looks like a Bushâs guest home.",1

160,CNN Admits They Spread Fake News â Forced To APOLOGIZE,http://xbn-news.com/index.php/2017/06/27/cnn-admits-spread-fake-news-forced-apologize/,"CNN has spent the last few months blatantly spreading fake news about Donald Trump in the hopes of taking him down. Despite this, CNN has always claimed to be unbiased and has denied spinning fake news against Trump in any way.Now, however, CNN has finally been forced to admit that they are spreading fake news about the president.Conservative Fighters reported that CNN was forced to issue an apology after spreading fake news as they tried to connect some Trump associates to Russia. When it was confirmed that the story was indeed fake, CNN had to issue an apology with their tails between their legs.âOn June 22, 2017, CNN.com published a story connecting Anthony Scaramucci with investigations into the Russian Direct Investment Fund,â CNN said in their retraction. âThat story did not meet CNNâs editorial standards and has been retracted. Links to the story have been disabled. CNN apologizes to Mr. Scaramucci.âCNN also removed the original report from their website in the hopes that people wonât be able to see how far they go in their quest to spread lies. Hereâs that full report from CNN:Senate investigators are examining the activities of a little-known $10-billion Russian investment fund whose chief executive met with a member of President Donald Trumpâs transition team four days before Trumpâs inauguration, a congressional source told CNN.The source said the Senate intelligence committee is investigating the Russian fund in connection with its examination of discussions between White House adviser Jared Kushner and the head of a prominent Russian bank. The bank, Vnesheconombank, or VEB, oversees the fund, which has ties to several Trump advisers. Both the bank and the fund have been covered since 2014 by sanctions restricting U.S. business dealings.Separately, the Treasury Department has been looking into the Jan. 16 meeting between the fundâs chief executive and Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the transition teamâs executive committee and a fundraiser and adviser for Trumpâs presidential campaign, according to a Jan. 30 letter from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.Two Democratic senators asked Treasury to investigate whether Scaramucci promised to lift sanctions â a policy shift that would help the fund attract more international investment to Russia.The inquiries draw attention to the Russian Direct Investment Fund, a government investment arm that has helped top U.S. private-equity firms invest in Russia and that was advised by Stephen Schwarzman, who is now chairman of Trumpâs Strategic and Policy Forum, an advisory group of business leaders.Schwarzman, chief executive officer of Blackstone Group, was named in 2011 to the fundâs International Advisory Board along with other leaders of major equity companies and sovereigh-wealth funds who reviewed the fundâs operations, plans and potential investments. Schwarzman declined to comment. A source close to him said Schwarzman has not spoken to anyone on the fund âfor some time.âThe fund also worked with Goldman Sachs, whose former president Gary Cohn is Trumpâs chief economic adviser and where Kirill Dmitriev, the fundâs chief executive, worked as an investment banker in the 1990s. Goldman was part of a consortium created in 2012 to invest in large Russian businesses preparing to go public, and was hired in 2013 to burnish Russiaâs investment image. The company declined to comment.Senate and House investigators are looking into various Russian entities to determine whether anyone connected to the Trump campaign helped Russians as they meddled in the 2016 presidential election, and whether Trump associates discussed sanctions with Russian officials.The congressional inquiries, along with a criminal investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller, have shadowed the Trump administration. Trump has denied any connection to Russiaâs election-meddling, calling the criminal probe âa witch hunt.âScaramucci, a billionaire founder of SkyBridge Capital, minimized his January meeting with Dmitriev in the resort town of Davos, Switzerland, at the celebrated annual gathering of the World Economic Forum. Scaramucci had met Dmitriev at previous Davos meetings, although at the gathering in January, Scaramucci was expecting to be named White House liaison to the business community.Dmitriev âcame over to say hello in a restaurant, and I was cordial,â Scaramucci said in a recent email to CNN. âThere is nothing there.âThe day after the meeting, Scaramucci told Bloomberg TV that he had âas a private citizenâ been working with Dmitriev on bringing a delegation of executives to Russia.âWhat I said to him last night, in my capacity inside the administration, I would certainly reach out to some people to help him,â Scaramucci said before describing a thicket of ethical clearances he would face. âThe idea was many months ago to have more outreach with Russia but also other countries, not just Russia. China, other countries.âScaramucciâs comments alarmed Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ben Cardin of Maryland, who asked Mnuchin investigate whether Scaramucci sought to âfacilitate prohibited transactionsâ or promised to waive or lift sanctions against Russia.In a reply Jan. 30, before he was sworn in, Mnuchin said he would âensure the appropriate Department components assess whether further investigation of this matter is warranted.â The Treasury Department did not respond to CNN requests for an update.A spokeswoman for the Russian fund said the two men did not discuss sanctions, and that the discussion itself did not violate sanctions that U.S. imposed in 2014 after Russia annexed part of neighboring Ukraine. The spokeswoman declined to describe the conversation, saying, âWe do not comment on private meetings.âSince Trumpâs election, Dmitriev has been one of Russiaâs most vocal officials in calling for an end to U.S. sanctions and arguing that joint U.S.-Russia projects can create jobs in the United States.The fund hired two U.S. lobbying firms in September 2014, after sanctions were imposed, paying them a combined $150,000 over two months for public relations work. The fund has not hired any lobbyists since then.With a history of helping U.S. manufacturers and asset management companies invest in Russia. The fund is a logical starting point for Russiaâs push to lift U.S. sanctions, former State Department chief economist Rodney Ludema said.âIf youâre going to get your nose under the tent, thatâs a good place to start,â said Ludema, a Georgetown University economics professor. âIâm sure their objective is to get rid of all the sanctions against the financial institutions. But RDIF is one [sanctioned organizations] where a number of prominent U.S. investors have been involved.âScaramucci also questioned U.S. sanctions while he was in Davos and echoed Trumpâs statements about improving relations with Russia.Two weeks after the meeting between Scaramucci and Dmitriev, when President Trump spoke by phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the fund announced it would open an office in New York in May.No New York office has been opened but the fund âstill expects to open a representative office in the US this year,â the spokeswoman said.SHARE this story so we can EXPOSE CNN for spreading FAKE NEWS!",1
161,MEXICAN PRESIDENT: âWE AGREE TO PAY FOR THE WALL IF THE DEAL INCLUDES RETURNING TEXAS TO MEXICOâ,http://xbn-news.com/index.php/2017/07/16/mexican-president-agree-pay-wall-deal-includes-returning-texas-mexico/,"U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a friendly phone call with Mexicoâs president on Friday but asserted he will renegotiate trade deals and other aspects of the countriesâ ties because Mexico has âbeat us to a pulpâ in the past. Mexicoâs peso extended gains on news of the call. The two men spoke for about an hour on Friday, a day after President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped a planned meeting in Washington next week over Trumpâs insistence that Mexico pay for a multibillion-dollar border wall. âIt was a very, very friendly call,â Trump told a joint news conference with visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May.Similarly, President Nieto conveyed a similar message in his interview with El Universal, the largest news agency in Mexico City. âI can tell you I am happy with what was said and what was agreed upon,â the president revealed. âI am convinced that we can have a friendly, respectful relationship with the United States as well as with President Trump.â Asked to elaborate on the topics mentioned during the hour-long telephone call, President Nieto said that he was not at liberty to disclose that, but did mention there was talk about the wall between the two countries, as well as a possible âdealâ that might be struck in the future.âI was very blunt and open with him, since I donât believe him to be a man who cares much about pleasantries or protocol,â the Mexican president said. âI told him Mexico would agree to pay for the wall only under the condition that our country and the Mexican people be compensated for it in some other way. While we were talking, the though came to me that perhaps I could ask him to have his engineers design the wall so that it puts Texas in Mexican territory; in other words, to build the wall so that it excludes Texas from the United States. I though that would be fair, since we would be paying for the construction.âHe added, âI could tell he didnât like the idea, but to be fair â he did say he would think about it. And if you think about it rationally, youâll arrive at the conclusion that itâs a somewhat fair trade-off. Sure, on one hand our national budget would be nearly depleted, since the initial cost of construction is still only based on loose estimates. However, getting Texas back after all this time would be a huge victory for Mexico.ââI have to add that I still havenât figured out what we would do with the conservative, inbred rednecks that reside there at the moment, but Iâm sure weâd be able to come to some sort of an arrangement. At the end of the day, we all know how huge a fan Donald Trump is of deporting people. Maybe he deserves a chance to have his campaign-long wish come true in the form of organizing the deportation of Texans to other U.S. states so that we can finally have our land back as empty and unspoiled as we left it,â Nieto concluded.",1
162,Feinstein: We Canât Increase Immigration Enforcement Because No One Will Pick Our Fruit,http://xbn-news.com/index.php/2017/08/06/feinstein-cant-increase-immigration-enforcement-no-one-will-pick-fruit/,"California Sen. Dianne Feinstein warned that President Donald Trumpâs immigration plan would severely cripple the agriculture industry in a Wednesday evening interview.âWeâre the largest agricultural producer in America Itâs a $50 billion industry. We employ tens of thousands of agricultural workers,â The Democratic senator said on CNN. âThey are among a class that this would be prohibited. It would cripple agriculture if they didnât have the people coming in to do this work,âShe went on to argue that Americans just arenât interested in working in 100-degree temperatures. âSo you would have a severe crippling of the largest ag industry in America, âshe concluded.The Trump administration worked with Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia to produce a bill that could halve the number of people legally accepted into the country over the next ten years, according to The Hill.Feinstein isnât the first senator to use that same line of attack against the bill known as the RAISE Act. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham announced he opposed the act due to its potential effects on agriculture in his home state.âSouth Carolinaâs number one industry is agriculture and tourism is number two,â the senator said in an official statement. âIf this proposal were to become law, it would be devastating to our stateâs economy which relies on this immigrant workforce.âThe act under consideration would only affect green card holders, a program that agriculture doesnât rely on to find foreign workers. Instead, the industry largely finds labor through the H-2 work Visa program, something that isnât even addressed in the RAISE Act.Feinsteinâs office did not immediately return a request for comment on the story.",1

166,Obama Stole The PresidencyâNew Report Shows Millions Of Illegals Flipped The 2008 Election,http://americanprides.com/2017/08/29/obama-stole-the-presidency-new-report-shows-millions-of-illegals-flipped-the-2008-election/http://www.snopes.com/illegal-immigrants-2008-election/,"Democrats should be careful, because the shaky foundation beneath their feet is falling apart. The Left has spent years painting conservatives as paranoid conspiracy theorists who complain about voter fraud instead of focusing on the real issues. That is why, according to the Left, conservatives lose elections. But what happens when the truth comes out, and conservatives were right the whole time? Does the Left then start to get paranoid? We should know the answers to these questions at some point in the near future, because the truth is indeed starting to come out. As reported by The Washington Times: A research group in New Jersey has taken a fresh look at postelection polling data and concluded that the number of noncitizens voting illegally in U.S. elections is likely far greater than previous estimates. As many as 5.7 million noncitizens may have voted in the 2008 election, which put Barack Obama in the White House. The research organization Just Facts, a widely cited, independent think tank led by self-described conservatives and libertarians, revealed its number-crunching in a report on national immigration. Just Facts President James D. Agresti and his team looked at data from an extensive Harvard/YouGov study that every two years questions a sample size of tens of thousands of voters. Some acknowledge they are noncitizens and are thus ineligible to vote. There you have it: conservatives were right about voter fraud. When President Trump stated that he would have won the popular vote in addition to the Electoral College had no illegals voted in the 2016 election, liberals openly mocked him. As stated before, anyone who agreed with Trump was a loony conspiracy theorist. It did not take much to realize, however, that liberals had no actual response to these claims. They refuted the Presidentâs argument only by calling him a âsore loser.â They did not, on the other hand, actually prove him wrong. As it turns out, liberals did not prove Trump wrong because he simply was not wrong in the first place. A fresh batch of studies confirm that millions of illegals may have voted for Hillary Clinton as well. What do you think, America? Should liberals be held accountable now that Americans have the proof? Is this a matter for the Justice Department, or should Democrats just pay for it at the polls?

167,You Will Be Shocked When You Learn What Planned Parenthood Wants To Teach Preschoolers About Sex,http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/you-will-be-shocked-when-you-learn-what-planned-parenthood-wants-to-teach-preschoolers-about-sex,"What should we teach children that are three and four years old about sex? If you said ânothingâ in response to that question, that was the right answer. Exposing very young children to graphic material about human sexuality at a very early age can be extremely detrimental, but that is precisely what Planned Parenthood wants to do. And I am not just talking about run of the mill sexual education. Planned Parenthood has just released new guidelines for educating preschoolers that include entire sections about transgenderism and masturbation. And remember, U.S. taxpayers are paying for all of this, because Planned Parenthood receives about 500 million dollars from the U.S. government every year. The Republicans have control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, and so there is absolutely no excuse for not defunding Planned Parenthood as soon as possible.When I first learned about these new guidelines, I was absolutely stunned. Little children that are three and four years old are just learning to put sentences together, and yet Planned Parenthood wants them to start learning about sexuality and gender roles at that age? The following comes from Matt Millerâ¦New guidelines have been issued on the Planned Parenthood website containing detailed methods for talking to preschoolers about gender roles, sexuality, masturbation, transgenderism, and even ways of determining whether your child is trans or not.In these new guidelines, there is even a section for parents that are wondering if their little preschooler is transgender. According to Planned Parenthood, parents of a potentially âtransgender preschoolerâ should let them âwear what they want, have the haircut they want, and even use a name that reflects their genderââ¦If you think your child might be transgender but donât know what to do, talking with a counselor or therapist whoâs familiar and supportive of LGBTQ identities is a good idea. Talking with other families with trans or gender nonconforming kids can be helpful, too â for both you and your child. There are community groups like PFLAG which may be in your area, and there are also lots of parenting groups online.Itâs also a good idea to talk to your child directly about their gender if you think they might be transgender or gender expansive. Ask them if theyâre a boy or a girl, and how they know that to be true. If they are transgender, giving them the power to wear what they want, have the haircut they want, and even use a name that reflects their gender are all going to be really important for them to feel safe, especially once they start going to school. For help talking to your child about this stuff, Gender Spectrum is a good place to start.This is wrong on so many levels, but if you speak out against these things you might be the one that is branded as a criminal.In fact, a new law that is moving through the California legislature is so bizarre that it is hard to believe that it is actually real. If you do not use the proper pronoun for transgender senior citizens in California, you could soon be slapped with a huge fine or even be sent to prison. The following comes from Charisma Newsâ¦California is on its way to passing a new law that makes it illegal to call transgender senior citizens a pronoun they donât like. For example, if an elderly person who was born male and lives in a long-term care facility wishes to be called âherâ or âshe,â the workers there had better do it or face the consequences. The proposed law would even apply to Christian facilities.SB 219, titled the âLesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Long-Term Care Facility Residentâs Bill of Rights,â states, âIt shall be unlawful for a long-term care facility or facility staff to. â¦ willfully and repeatedly fail to use a residentâs preferred name or pronouns after being clearly informed of the preferred name or pronouns.â It imposes fines and jail time on any long-term care employee who refuses to use transgender pronouns. Fines for repeat offenders could be as high as $1,000 and a jail term of up to a year.Regardless of what you believe, this is supposed to be a nation that protects free speech.If you want to stand up against this sort of tyranny, I would encourage you to support my campaign by visiting HelpMichaelWin.com. If I am elected, I promise to fight these kinds of laws as hard as I can.Already, it is getting to the point where those that believe in traditional values will no longer be able to participate in the wedding industry. For example, a bridal shop in Pennsylvania has been forced to temporarily close its doors because it wouldnât participate in a gay weddingâ¦A Christian-owned bridal shop in Pennsylvania has temporarily closed its doors to the public and is now only accepting appointments after its owner received threats because the shop refused to serve a lesbian couple looking for a wedding dress, a source close to the situation told The Christian Post.This case got national attention, but the owners of the bridal shop have no intention of caving inâ¦âThe owners of W.W. Bridal Boutique reserve the rights afforded to them by the First Amendment of the Constitution to live out our lives according to our faith,â the W.W. Bridal post was quoted as stating. âWe will continue to serve our customers based on the tenets of our faith.âFollowing the PGN report, nationally recognized left-leaning outlets such as the Huffington Post and Yahoo Style picked up on the article. The shopâs co-owner, Victoria Miller, told the Huffington Post in an email that their refusal was based on a matter of religious beliefs.Sadly, small businesses such as this one are being slapped with lawsuits all over the nation for not participating in gay weddings, and many small businesses have already been financially ruined by such lawsuits.If we do not stand up against the forces of political correctness and fight for freedom of speech and freedom of religion, our rights will continually be eroded until they are almost entirely gone.This is a critical moment in our history, and if we lose this fight the future of our nation will be very bleak indeed.Michael Snyder is a Republican candidate for Congress in Idahoâs First Congressional District, and you can learn how you can get involved in the campaign on his official website.

The drug war down there continues to spiral completely out of control, and often the violence spills over to our own side of the border. Thanks to President Trump, security along the border is improving, but we still have a long, long way to go. Ultimately what we need is a physical barrier, because large numbers of illegal immigrants continue to pour through the soft spots in our border security. I know that a lot of liberals donât like the idea of a wall, but that is the only way that we are going to make sure that everyone comes into this country through the front door.The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we will always need a certain level of immigration from other nations. But prior to the Trump administration, our approach to immigration policy was absolutely insane. We had made the legal immigration process an extremely costly and complicated nightmare that hardly anyone could understand or navigate, and yet we had kept the back door completely wide open for drug dealers, gang members, terrorists, sexual predators and anyone that just wanted to take advantage of the system.We have got to make our legal system of immigration less costly and less complicated, and at the same time we need to slam the back door completely shut so that everyone is forced to come in to the U.S. through the front door.To illustrate why this is such an incredibly important issue, I would like to share the story of Estefania Soto with you. Thanks to a drunk illegal immigrant, Soto lost her boyfriend and her baby recently in a horrific traffic accidentâ¦Estefania Soto has spent her days in various hospital rooms since the crash on June 10. She and her boyfriend, 28-year-old Raul Diaz, Jr., were on a motorcycle on Farm to Market 973 near FM 969 in east Travis County when they were hit head-on by a truck.The crash killed Diaz and resulted in the premature birth of their child. Soto, 26, was only six months pregnant. Their baby was delivered through a C-section after the crash and passed away shortly after.Soto has had 15 surgeries over the past month including a leg amputation.If Trumpâs wall had already been in place, 38-year-old Cesar Corona-Quiterio may have never had the chance to enter this country illegally and Estefania Soto may still be looking forward to a new life with her husband and her baby.Another tragedy that could have potentially been averted by a wall on the southern border was the brutal rape of a 14-year-old girl at a high school in Rockville, Maryland. The following comes from Fox Newsâ¦Jose O. Montano, 17, from El Salvador, and Henry E. Sanchez-Milian, 18, from Guatemala, were charged with first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree sexual offense after they allegedly attacked the girl at 9 a.m. last Thursday.âThe victim was walking in a school hallway when she met two male students, identified as Montano and Sanchez. Montano asked the victim to walk with him and Sanchez. Montano asked the victim to engage in sexual intercourse. She refused,â Montgomery County Police said in a statement.âMontano asked the victim again and then forced her into a boyâs bathroom and then into a stall. Montano and Sanchez both raped the victim inside the bathroom stall.âHow would you feel if that was your own daughter?I donât understand how people can be against the wall. We literally have a war zone on the other side of the border, and CNN has reported that the drug war down in Mexico claimed an astounding 23,000 lives last yearâ¦It was the second deadliest conflict in the world last year, but it hardly registered in the international headlines.As Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan dominated the news agenda, Mexicoâs drug wars claimed 23,000 lives during 2016 â second only to Syria, where 50,000 people died as a result of the civil war.And the rising violence in Mexico and much of the rest of central America has been slowly spreading to communities all across the United States. For example, just check out what has been happening on Long Islandâ¦With MS-13 blamed for a trail of 11 corpses of mostly young people found since the start of the school year in Brentwood and Central Islip, the nationâs focus has turned on how the Central American street gang built such a presence here.The bloodshed in the two blue-collar towns has gotten the attention of President Donald Trump, who says the killings are the result of lax immigration policies that let too many criminal âscumâ slip through.Attorney General Jeff Sessions gave a speech Friday not far from a park where the bodies of four young men were found this month bearing MS-13âs hallmarks: repeated slashes from a blade that left the victims nearly unrecognizable.Are you starting to understand why I am so adamant about building Trumpâs wall?We need to build it high, we need to build it strong, and we need armed guards patrolling every inch of it.One of the fundamental duties of the federal government is national security, and for decades prior to the Trump administration we had leaders that absolutely refused to secure our borders.Thankfully, now we have a president that is determined to do something about this national crisis, but we still have a Congress that is intent on blocking him every step of the way.Every member of Congress that doesnât want Trumpâs wall needs to go, and they need to be replaced by new blood that is ready to do whatever is necessary in order to protect the American people.Michael Snyder is a Republican candidate for Congress in Idahoâs First Congressional District, and you can learn how you can get involved in the campaign on his official website.

169,There Are Population Control Centers All Over America â They Are Called âPlanned Parenthood Clinicsâ,http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/there-are-population-control-centers-all-over-america-they-are-called-planned-parenthood-clinics,"The phrase âfamily planningâ is just a more palatable way of saying âpopulation controlâ. In the United States today, Planned Parenthood operates 650 âhealth centersâ that work tirelessly to promote abortion and other âfamily planning measuresâ. Planned Parenthood says that approximately 2.5 million people visit their âhealth centersâ each year, and somewhere around 60 million people visit their website. If you are pregnant and you visit one of their clinics, abortion will be pushed very hard. In fact, former Planned Parenthood workers have told us that they actually have abortion sales quotas, and workers that meet those quotas are rewarded with pizza parties and other incentives. Of course making money is one of the primary goals, but Planned Parenthood has also always had a very deep connection to eugenics and population control.Planned Parenthood was founded by a very strong proponent of eugenics named Margaret Sanger. In her writings she strongly denounced the âhuman weedsâ and âreckless breedersâ that she felt were bringing unfit children into this world that society would have to care for. And in a 1932 Senate hearing, she advocated a ârigid policy of sterilization and segregationâ for those that were not of the right genetic stockâ¦âThe main objectives of the[proposed] Population Congress is toâ¦apply a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is already tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring.âIn other words, Sanger believed that some humans are far superior to others, and that everything possible should be done to keep the inferior humans from breeding. In fact, even NPR has admitted that Sanger strongly believed in the eugenics movementâ¦In reading her papers, it is clear Sanger had bought into the movement. She once wrote that âconsequences of breeding from stock lacking human vitality always will give us social problems and perpetuate institutions of charity and crime.âOf course Planned Parenthood continued to have strong ties to the eugenics movement long after Sanger died. In 1969, a plan to âreduce U.S. fertilityâ was outlined in a memo that was authored by Planned Parenthood Vice President Frederick Jaffe. The following comes from an article by Ann Olsonâ¦In 1969, then Vice President of Planned Parenthood, Frederick Jaffe, sent a memo to the head of the Population Council, Bernard Berelson. It included a table of âProposed Measures to Reduce U.S. Fertility.â The Jaffe/Berelson Memo was drawn up by Jaffe as a companion piece to Berelsonâs paper, âBeyond Family Planningâ published in the Population Councilâs February 1969 issue of Studies in Family Planning.This shocking memo makes suggestions for policy changes to be implemented in order to achieve population control:â¢ Restructure familyâ¢ Postpone or avoid marriageâ¢ Alter image of ideal family sizeâ¢ Compulsory education of childrenâ¢ Encourage increased homosexualityâ¢ Educate for family limitationâ¢ Fertility control agents in water supplyâ¢ Encourage women to work and provide few child care facilitiesâ¢ Compulsory abortion of out-of-wedlock pregnanciesâ¢ Compulsory sterilization of all who have two children except for a few who would be allowed threeâ¢ Confine childbearing to a limited number of adultsâ¢ Payments to encourage sterilizationâ¢ Payments to encourage contraceptionâ¢ Payments to encourage abortionâ¢ Abortion and sterilization on demandOf course many of the things on that list have actually been implemented since that time.The dramatic changes that we have seen in America regarding marriage, family and sexuality over the past several decades have not happened by accident. The enemies of our way of life have an agenda, and they have been working tirelessly to carry it out.Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, close to 60 million Americans have been murdered in our countryâs abortion mills, and Planned Parenthood has been the biggest offender by far.According to Planned Parenthoodâs latest annual report, they performed 328,348 abortions during the year that concluded on September 30th, 2015.During that same year, Planned Parenthood got 554.6 million dollars from the federal government. That accounts for more than 40 percent of their budget, and it is questionable if Planned Parenthood would be able to continue to exist without all of that funding.By giving Planned Parenthood more than half a billion dollars a year, the U.S. government is placing a giant stamp of approval on what they are doing. This is a national disgrace, and it must end.And just like their founder Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood seems to place a special emphasis on promoting âfamily planningâ among minorities. In the United States today, African-American women are more than 5 times as likely to get an abortion as white women are. In 2010, African-American women accounted for approximately 6.6 percent of the U.S. population, but they got 35.7 percent of the abortions.Planned Parenthood workers commonly stress what a financial burden a new baby will be to poor and minority women, and they are able to convince many of them that murdering their own children is the right thing to do.When you go to a Planned Parenthood clinic, you are not going to get an objective viewpoint. They are in business to do abortions, and that is what is going to get pushed. According to Planned Parenthoodâs latest report, Planned Parenthood does 1 adoption referral for every 114 abortions that it performs.And most women that get abortions donât even realize that the body parts of their babies are being harvested and sold off to the highest bidder.Planned Parenthood is committing crimes against humanity on a daily basis, and our national leaders are doing nothing to stop this.They should be deeply, deeply ashamed of themselves.If I run for Congress in 2018, and I am very, very strongly considering that, I would promise to always vote against any bill that includes even a single penny of funding for Planned Parenthood.And if we could get every Republican in the House of Representatives to pledge to never vote for funding for Planned Parenthood under any circumstances, we could finally ensure that Planned Parenthood would be defunded once and for all.I am so sick and tired of these politicians that use the Pro-Life label to get our votes but then they continue to vote to fund Planned Parenthood time after time.You cannot be Pro-Life and vote to fund Planned Parenthood, and any politician that wants to try to continue to play this game is not going to get our votes.Nearly 60 million children have already died, and if we are not going to take a stand now when will we ever be ready to do it?It is time to defund Planned Parenthood, and it is time to end abortion in America.If we want to have any sort of a future as a nation, there are no other alternatives.",1
170,Dreams And Visions Of Jesus Are Fueling The Explosive Growth Of Christianity In Muslim Nations Worldwide,http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/dreams-and-visions-of-jesus-are-fueling-the-explosive-growth-of-christianity-in-muslim-nations-worldwide,"Millions of Muslims all over the world are giving their lives to Jesus Christ, and in many instances this is happening because of dreams, visions and other supernatural encounters. Recently I have been writing a lot about the decline of Christianity in America and about the judgment that is about to hit our churches. Fortunately, the decaying state of the church in the United States is only a small part of the overall story. In other areas of the globe, Christianity is experiencing absolutely explosive growth even in the midst of horrendous persecution. This is particularly true in Islamic nations, where we are seeing things happen that could have come straight out of the Book of Acts.All over the planet, Jesus is personally visiting Muslims in supernatural ways, and this has resulted in an enormous wave of conversions. Earlier today, I ran across an article about a family of Syrian refugees that converted to Christianity while living in Lebanon, and it all happened because of a dreamâ¦Abu Radwan enters a church on the outskirts of Beirut with his wife and two kids. His wife removes the black headscarf covering her hair. It was here, a year and a half ago, that they converted to Christianity.âOf course it was a difficult decision,â Abu Radwan says. âI was born into a Muslim family.âThe family is from the city of Homs in Syria. They sought refuge in Lebanon at the beginning of the war. Then two years ago, Abu Radwan says Jesus appeared to him in a dream.âI started going to the church,â he says. âI believed that Jesus was coming to help us, to save us.âWhen it comes to supernatural encounters, there is literally nobody that is out of the reach of the Lord Jesus. One of my favorite examples is a former ISIS fighter that came to know the Lord after Jesus told him in a dream that he was âkilling my peopleââ¦Gina Fadely, the director of Youth With A Mission Frontier Missions (YWAM), told The Voice of the Martyrs Radio Network one of their workers met a former ISIS fighter who murdered Christians, but converted after a dream:âHe told this YWAM leader that he had begun having dreams of this man in white who came to him and said, âYou are killing my people.â And he started to feel really sick and uneasy about what he was doing,â Fadely continued. âThe fighter said just before he killed one Christian, the man said, âI know you will kill me, but I give to you my Bible.â The Christian was killed and this ISIS fighter actually took the Bible and began to read it. In another dream, Jesus asked him to follow him and he was now asking to become a follower of Christ and to be discipled.âAnd what has been happening in Iran is nothing short of miraculous. In one of the most radical Islamic nations on the entire planet, millions have come to faith in Christ over the past two decades, and dreams and visions are playing a major roleâ¦As Faithwire noted back in November, an Iranian Christian pastor claimed at the time that thereâs a stunning revival underway in his country, where he says the number of Christian adherents has increased from 100,000 in 1994 to 3 million today. Some claim that Jesus has been appearing in dreams and that those visions have helped spark the conversions.This is part of the great last days move of God that I have been telling people about. In the western world, there seems to be a great misconception that there are hundreds of millions of people in the Islamic world that are âout of the reach of the gospelâ. But this has never been the case, because with God all things are possible.Just look at the wonderful revival that is going on in Bangladesh. Officially, 89 percent of the population of Bangladesh is Muslim, about 10 percent are Hindus, and less than one percent is Christian. But unofficially it is being estimated that somewhere around 10 percent of the entire nation has now come to Christ, and they continue to convert in huge wavesâ¦Pastor Khaleque, 60, a former Muslim and now a Christian street pastor who works among the hill tribes, in the northeast part of Bangladesh, told CFI, âIn the last 12 months, more than 20,000 Muslims have converted to Christianity. More than 20,000 have converted, and this is becoming a real problem for the Muslims.âThe harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.Perhaps we are just way too comfortable in the western world. We donât have to pay much of a price for our faith, and so most people donât seem to take it very seriously.On the other side of the world, standing up for your faith can literally cost you your life. The following comes from a Fox News report from last yearâ¦A Christian womanâs fateful and defiant stance in front of a bulldozer last week evoked the memory of Tiananmen Square and has become a rallying cry against persecution at the hands of the Beijing government.The woman, identified by Christian activists as Ding Cuimei, wife of the Rev. Li Jiangong, was trying to stop the government-ordered demolition of Beitou Church in the central Hena province city of Zhumadian. Unlike the iconic man who brazenly stopped a tank in the 1989 uprising, Ding was pushed into a ditch and buried alive as horrified congregants watched helplessly.Would you be willing to stand in front of a bulldozer and face potential death for what you believe?You donât have to be the richest, or the smartest or the best looking to be used by God.You just have to be willing to be totally sold out for Him.In the western world we are drowning in money and resources, and there are church buildings all over the place, and yet the United States, Canada and Europe are all becoming âpost-Christian societiesâ.But elsewhere we are witnessing an explosion of the faith that is absolutely unprecedented. The following comes from Charles Colsonâ¦For instance, in 1900, there were approximately 10 million Christians in Africa. By 2000, there were 360 million. By 2025, conservative estimates see that number rising to 633 million. Those same estimates put the number of Christians in Latin America in 2025 at 640 million and in Asia at 460 million.I believe that a great move of God is coming to the western world too, but a great shaking is going to have to come first. Hearts have grown so hard and so prideful that it is going to take a great humbling before most people understand that they need the Lord. So even though the shaking will be very challenging, we should welcome it, because it will shake multitudes into the Kingdom of God.",1
171,New Report Says Islam Will Surpass Christianity And Become The Largest Religion In The World,http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/new-report-says-islam-will-surpass-christianity-and-become-the-largest-religion-in-the-world,"If current trends continue, Islam is on track to become the largest religion in the entire world by the end of this century according a stunning new report that was just released by the Pew Research Center. While it is true that Christianity is still growing on a global basis, it is not growing nearly as rapidly as Islam. So unless something changes, Christianity will only be the second largest faith in the world by the year 2070. According to this newly released report, Islam is the only major religion that is growing faster than the global population overall, and it is being projected that the number of Muslims on the planet will rise by a staggering 73 percent between 2010 and 2050â¦Islam is the only religion growing faster than the worldâs population, and it will be the largest in the world by 2070, research has found.US-based Pew Research Center analyzed demographic change among the worldâs major religions and found that the worldâs population of Muslims will grow by 73 percent between 2010 and 2050, compared to 35 percent for Christians, the next fastest-growing faith.The worldâs population will grow by 37 percent over the same period. If those rates of growth continue past 2050, Muslims will outnumber Christians by 2070, the report found.Of course there are religious groups that are growing even faster than Islam, but they were not part of this study.For example, I have previously written about how witchcraft is the fastest growing faith in America, and yesterday I wrote about how membership in the Satanic Temple in the United States has been absolutely exploding since Donald Trump was elected.So it isnât just Islam that is gaining ground.But without a doubt, Islam is now the dominant worldview on much of the planet. Many in the western world tend to think of it as a Middle Eastern religion, but the truth is that most Muslims actually live in the Asia-Pacific regionâ¦Some 62 percent of Muslims live in the Asia-Pacific region with large populations in Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran and Turkey, Pew researchers said.In 2050, India is set to take over from Indonesia as the country with the worldâs largest Muslim population, according to the study.In India, there truly is a battle going on for the spiritual future of that nation right now. Christianity and Islam are both making a tremendous amount of progress, and this has greatly upset a lot of traditional Hindu groups.Islam is making a lot of progress in Europe as well. A tremendous amount of immigration has caused the number of European Muslims to surge in recent years, and this new report is projecting that 10 percent of all Europeans will belong to Islam by the year 2050.Here in the United States, Muslims still only make up a very small percentage of the population, but that percentage is growing too. The following comes directly out of the new Pew Research Center reportâ¦In 2015, according to our best estimate, there were 3.3 million Muslims of all ages in the U.S., or about 1% of the U.S. population. Pew Research Centerâs 2014 Religious Landscape Study (conducted in English and Spanish) found that 0.9% of U.S. adults identify as Muslims. A 2011 survey of Muslim Americans, which was conducted in English as well as Arabic, Farsi and Urdu, estimated that there were 1.8 million Muslim adults (and 2.75 million Muslims of all ages) in the country. That survey also found that a majority of U.S. Muslims (63%) are immigrants.Our demographic projections estimate that Muslims will make up 2.1% of the U.S. population by the year 2050, surpassing people who identify as Jewish on the basis of religion as the second-largest faith group in the country (not including people who say they have no religion).Once the number of Muslims in the United States surpasses the number of Jewish people, what impact will that have on U.S. politics?That is something to think about.The report indicated that there are a couple of primary reasons why Islam is growing so rapidly around the world.First of all, Muslims tend to have larger families than everyone else. The report said that the average Muslim woman has 3.1 children during her lifetime, while all other groups only have 2.3 children per woman.So in the end, Islam could end up dominating the world just by simply making more babies than everyone else.Muslims are also younger on average than other religious groups. According to the report, on a global basis Muslims are âseven years younger than the median age of non-Muslimsâ.Unfortunately, when Muslims become dominant in a society they often want to impose their systems of government, law, economics, etc. on everyone else. That is why âsharia lawâ is such a sensitive issue, and the report found that in some Islamic countries an overwhelming majority of Muslims want to impose sharia law on everyone elseâ¦For instance, a Pew Research Center survey of Muslims in 39 countries asked Muslims whether they want sharia law, a legal code based on the Quran and other Islamic scripture, to be the official law of the land in their country. Responses on this question vary widely. Nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99%) and most in Iraq (91%) and Pakistan (84%) support sharia law as official law. But in some other countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia â including Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%) and Azerbaijan (8%) â relatively few favor the implementation of sharia law.In his new book entitled âMystery Babylon: Unlocking the Bibleâs Greatest Prophetic Mysteryâ, best-selling author Joel Richardson suggests that the identity of the âMystery Babylonâ that we read about in the Book of Revelation could actually be Mecca.I am not sure whether that is true or not, but nobody can deny that Islam is one of the most dominant forces on the entire planet in 2017, and it looks like it is going to become even more dominant in the years ahead.And that is troubling news for Christians and those of other faiths, because all you have to do is to look at countries such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Iran to see what happens to other faiths once Islam takes total control of a nation.In a truly Islamic state, there is no room for religious freedom, and so the growth of Islam is likely to be one of the greatest global threats to the free exercise of religion for the foreseeable future.",1
172,"Look whatâs dropped by 70% since Trump took office! Yep, you guessed it!",http://donaldtrumppotus45.com/2017/07/19/look-whats-dropped-by-70-since-trump-took-office-yep-you-guessed-it/,"President Trump electrified the nation during last yearâs Presidential campaign tour. He brought back hope for Americans and our American way of life which had long been dead, especially under the tutelage of recently ousted, failed U.S. President B. Hussein Obama, who proved to be the President for the rest of the world, especially Middle Eastern interests, rather than the President of the United States.One of the things President Trump campaigned on was immigration reform. He promised to build a big, beautiful wall on our border with Mexico to keep undesirable aliens from entering our country illegally, forcing those immigrants that are safe to come here to wait in line, pay their fees, and be fully vetted before coming.It seems that our neighbors to the south of the border are so intimidated by President Trumpâs stance on illegal immigration that the wall hasnât even been necessary to get them to stop their illegal entering into our great nation.",1
173,Read Hillary Clinton's Georgetown Speech on Women's Role in Peace and Politics,http://time.com/4721094/hillary-clinton-georgetown-transcript/,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Friday honored the role of women in global politics and implored the Trump Administration not to retreat from making the U.S. a leader ""on behalf of peace in the world.""""This Administration's proposed cuts to international health, development and diplomacy would be a blow to women and children and a grave mistake for our country,"" she said in her remarks at the award ceremony hosted by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security.""We have to ask, will we be left behind or will we continue to lead the way?"" Clinton added. ""I hope the answer is that we will do whatever it takes to make our country and the world stronger and more secure.""Read Clinton's full remarks here:Good morning! [applause]Thank you! Thank you so much. [applause]Thank you. [crowd chanting ""Hillary""]Thank you. Wow, let's do that again. [laughter] [applause]This warm, warm welcome is one of the many reasons that I always appreciate coming to this campus, to this great university. And I am so pleased to have a chance to talk with you today about an issue that, as President DeGioia said, is one that has really provided the impetus for a lot of the work that is being done here at the university, particularly in the institute that has been the first of its kind anywhere in the world studying women and security and the contributions that can be made.And I'm grateful to President DeGioiaâs visionary leadership and to this university for your commitment to nurturing diplomats, peacemakers and leaders. I am one of those who thinks we need more peacemakers, diplomats and leaders who are devoted to the ongoing and difficult work of bridging divides, of bringing people together, of trying to find common ground.Now, some of you may have been here back in 2011 when we announced the creation of this institute. It came about for an ultimately profoundly simple reason. About a decade earlier, there had been a landmark resolution passed in the UN Security Council affirming women's crucial roles in peace and security. But the promise of that resolution has, with very few exceptions, remained largely unfulfilled. This is something that I talk often about with my close friend and predecessor, Secretary Madeleine Albright, who bleeds blue and gray. [applause]Because we thought back in the â90s that we needed to do more to elevate the rights and opportunities of women and girls on every level â obviously, education and health and economic opportunity, but also to unleash the potential for involvement in ending conflicts, in creating more secure environments for all people to live in and thrive. So on that day, back in 2011, we came here to Georgetown to declare that the issue of women's full participation in peace and security could no longer be relegated to the margins of international affairs. [applause]I believed then âand, I have to tell you, I believe even more fiercely today â that advancing the rights and full participation of women and girls is the great, unfinished business of the 21st century. [applause]It seems self-evident. Itâs not only the right and moral goal for us to be pursuing. After all, women represent half of humanity, and we do have a fundamental right to participate in the decisions that shape our lives. But â and this is what I want to really impress upon you â this is strategic and necessary for matters of peace, prosperity and security. It is not a partisan issue. Itâs a human issue. A rising tide of women's rights lifts entire nations. So each year, when Iâve had the chance to come back for these awards, I am inspired, although increasingly not surprised to see how far this institute has come. Georgetown is very fortunate, in my highly biased opinion, to have my dear friend, Ambassador Melanne Verveer, at the helm and backed up fully by the leadership of the university because the leaders â as President DeGioia just read out â that youâve recognized, women and men alike, have come from different backgrounds, certainly different countries, but united in the belief that women are not only victims of war, but must be viewed and helped to become agents of change, makers of peace and drivers of progress.That was the principle behind our efforts at the State Department in the first term of President Obama. We wanted to set a standard, and Iâm proud of it because I do see it as strategic and necessary. Not just a nice thing to do on the margins somewhere deep in the bowels of the State Department, but front and center. Because standing up for the rights and opportunities of women and girls must be a cornerstone of American global leadership. And therefore, it must be woven throughout our foreign policy with the resources, staffing, accountability and attention needed to back up that commitment. [applause]What I was very pleased by and excited to know is how the U.S. military also recognizes the role of women in peace and security. Over the years, Iâve had the privilege of working alongside and standing beside some of our military leaders right on this stage. Admiral Sandy Winnefeld, former vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, MichÃ¨le Flournoy, former undersecretary for defense for policy, helped to put new emphasis on stopping rape and gender-based violence in conflict zones and post-conflict areas and empowering women to help make and keep peace.This is especially important now, when we have, across the globe, more than 60 million refugees fleeing not only conflicts, but famine and drought and disease. And we have to come to terms with that because, again, it's not just somebody else's problem. It will affect the stability of nations and regions, which in turn, could very well bring problems, whether it be conflict and terrorism or disease and criminal activity to our shores. Global progress depends on the progress of women. I know we've seen positive results of that theme being actually implemented ever since the U.N. Women's Conference in Beijing in 1995. But I'm here also to say we are seeing signals of a shift that should alarm us all. This administration's proposed cuts to international health, development and diplomacy would be a blow to women and children and a grave mistake for our country. Some of you may have seen the recent letter from more than 120 retired generals and admirals to Congress and the administration, urging the Congress and the White House not to retreat from these programs, which represent our values. These distinguished men and women who served in uniform recognize that turning our back on diplomacy won't make our country safer. It will undermine our security and our standing in the world.Defense Secretary Mattis said it well when he said, âIf you cut funds to the State Department, that means he has to buy more ammunition.â So the work that is done here at this institute, here at Georgetown, making the evidence-based case for the role of women and peace in security is incredibly important. It's always mattered, but today, it's even more critical. As this institute has grown, so too has the body of evidence showing that when women participate in peacemaking and peacekeeping, we are all safer and more secure. Studies show â here I go again, talking about research, evidence and facts â [laughter] [applause]But in fact, when women are included in peace negotiations, agreements are less likely to fail and more likely to last. And we know that women's rights and physical safety are often the very first targets of fundamentalists. We also know that women are often the first to spot conflict on the horizon, coming their way. And when their insight and information is ignored, it often leads to consequences that might have been averted. At a time when sexual violence continues to be used as a strategy by terrorist groups, when women are being recruited by ISIS and Boko Haram, evidence suggests leaders who want to do more to guard against terrorism and violence should work even harder to help support and enable the participation of women. Now, before anybody jumps to any conclusions, I will state, clearly, women are not inherently more peaceful than men. That is a stereotype. That belongs in the alternative reality. [laughter] [applause]But, history does show that when women are at the peace table, they bring together coalitions, and they work really hard to build consensus. And they are the ones most likely to shine a bright light on issues of human rights, transitional justice, national reconciliation and economic renewal. I've seen this. Over the years, I worked with the women of Northern Ireland and watched as they reached across sectarian divides to forge a lasting peace.And when that process started back in the â90s, who would have ever predicted that Martin McGuinness, who just passed away, would ever shake hands with Queen Elizabeth? We've seen the women of Liberia force an end to a bloody civil war. If you've never seen the movie Pray the Devil Back to Hell, I highly recommend it because it shows, in very personal ways, the points that I am making from this podium today. The women of Liberia went to where the men had been talking about ending the conflict for weeks and weeks, a hotel in Ghana. They surrounded it, and they would not leave. They wouldnât let those who had met to negotiate the peace out of a window or a door until they came to agreement. And then, of course, they ended up electing Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as the first woman president on the continent of Africa. [applause]I have seen women in the Democratic Republic of Congo survive the most horrific, almost unimaginable abuse and cruelty and then summon the resilience to rebuild and help others go on. In Colombia, which you will hear much more about in a few minutes, a country whose trajectory I have followed intently for years, we've seen women organize, agitate and negotiate to help bring to a close more than 50 years of bloodshed. While conflict raged and efforts to stop the violence failed, women not only took their places at the table, they opened up the peace process to women across Colombia and urged over and over again that all parties not walk away until they reached an agreement.So if we are to build more just, free and peaceful countries and indeed a world, it's not enough just to pay lip service to empowering women. We have to take seriously their concerns and give them the tools to be equal partners in helping to shape the world they inhabit. The leaders we are honoring here today have seen that firsthand. From Humberto de la Calle, the rock of the peace negotiations in Havana. [applause] Yes, a round of applause for Humberto. [applause]MarÃ­a Paulina Riveros, one of two women appointed to represent the Colombian government in the talks. [applause]Elena Ambrosi, who has worked tirelessly behind the scenes, like so many women, to help make peace a reality. [applause]And Jineth Bedoya Lima, a journalist who continued her pursuit of the truth and her advocacy for victims of sexual violence in the face of her own horrors. [applause]Now like so many peace agreements, as hard as it was to get to it after 50 years of war, it is just the first step. Implementing peace will be a constant task. As hard as it is to imagine letting go of the peace that is so hard-won, there will be forces at work in the country from all sides to undermine it, to act as if it didnât apply to them. To do everything possible to prevent it from becoming the reality in the lives of Colombians that it can be. Yes, the work will require difficult decisions, transitional justice and economic viability. But peace is truly within reach.So, from peace processes, like the one we celebrate today, to important steps that nations and institutions are taking to recognize the role of women in confronting violent extremism and addressing climate change and standing up against terrorism and conflicts of all kinds, we've got to continue this work. And I am pleading that our government will continue its leadership role on behalf of peace in the world because the world must continue this work with or without U.S. involvement. [applause]And the choice is ours to make. In this complicated, interconnected, interdependent world of ours, itâs not as though you can pick one or two, three things that you say, âWell, thatâs all Iâm going to work on.â Events move too quickly. Borders dissolve in the face of pressures. The great connectivity of the internet can spawn both opportunity and despair. So we have to ask, will we be left behind or will we continue to lead the way? I hope the answer is that we will do whatever it takes to make our country and the world stronger and more secure. Standing up for our values, for human rights, and opportunities, security for all. And continuing to finish the business of making sure that girls and women have the same rights as men and boys. And by extending and guaranteeing those rights, unleashing human potential, the likes of which the world has never seen. That is what I hope your generation, students of Georgetown, will be committed to actually making a reality.Thank you all very much. [applause]",1
174,Ben Carson Digs Up Obamaâs Filthiest Skeleton â $500 Billion Fraud Uncovered/,http://americanprides.com/2017/08/08/ben-carson-digs-up-obamas-filthiest-skeleton-500-billion-fraud/,"During the later years of the disastrous Obama era, the president pushed all sorts of radical policies through various agencies. By allowing his comrades throughout the government to drastically change rules and laws on their own, Congress was successfully circumvented. Itâs bad enough when our moronic politicians shove crap down our throats but itâs even worse when unelected bureaucrats do it in secret. Thatâs just the epitome of corruption. One of the agencies most guilty of secret abuses is Housing and Urban Development. HUD has a scary amount of power in shaping our nationâs communities and not only that, ample opportunity exists for it to waste taxpayer money. And they didnât just waste your money under President Obama; they threw giant wads of it down the toilet. As reported at Yes Iâm Right, as the new head of HUD, Dr. Ben Carson called for an immediate audit to uncover any wastefulness and abuse. Why? Because this guy actually does his job. To no oneâs surprise â but to everyoneâs horror â the Inspector General in charge of the review found half a trillion dollars in unaccounted funds. Apparently, HUDâS books are so horribly managed that a full audit couldnât even be completed during an initial inquiry. Itâs so bad that this is looking less like incompetence and more like outright corruption and kickbacks. Hereâs what the report said: âWhen the IG remained unable to issue an opinion for fiscal years 2015 or 2016, he gave Obama staffers a three-month extension. Thus, their reprieve allowed them to fix $3.4 billion in 2015 errors and $516.4 billion in 2016 errors. After HUDâs re-submission of paperwork, 11 material weaknesses, seven significant deficiencies, and five instances of failure to comply with laws and regulations remain unresolved. The continued problems âwere due to an inability to establish a compliant control environment, implement adequate financial accounting systems, retain key financial staff, and identify appropriate accounting principles and policies.ââ Obamaâs HUD lackey, Brian Sullivan, dared to say otherwise on the matter, when in December of 2016 he claimed: âHUD does apply generally accepted accounting standards,â despite the fact the IG report concluded otherwise. That, and thereâs the half a trillion dollars in errors, which would lend credence to the IGâs conclusions. When Trump first tapped Carson for the HUD position, the typical circus of leftist clowns came out and bashed the choice, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) being one of the most critical.",1

Itâs simple.France set up tax payer funded, public housing for these third world peasants and they refuse to live in it. Instead, theyâve been setting up little squatter villages, just like they live in in their third world dumps, and theyâve been covering the streets of a once beautiful city with garbage, feces and urine. The French Government stepped in a couple of weeks ago to dismantle the squatter villages, and the peasants have been protesting ever since.",1

The decision shows just how close we came to disaster. The 5-4 ruling ultimately decided that Sharia Law or any ideology that contradicts basic human rights will not be taught in Americaâs public schools.This shows just how important the election of President Trump was and his decision to appoint Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.âThe government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isnât a government issue or a religious issue,â Gorsuch said in a statement. âThis is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion.

Lee is scheduled to make its debut in a handful of southern states later this month, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Treasury announced on Tuesday. The new bill includes a portrait of the middle-aged Confederate general on its face while the reverse side features a scene depicting the Second Battle of Bull Run. âWe are pleased to announce that the new twenty-dollar bill will make its debut on Monday, September 11th, in eleven states, including South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Virginia, Alabama, and Texas,â Treasury spokesperson Keith Davis announced during a press conference Tuesday morning. The decision to replace the existing twenty-dollar banknote, which entered circulation in 1996, comes as President Donald J. Trump continues to work diligently to reverse his predecessorâs policies. âWe had Barack Obama, who â for eight years and without any prior authorization from Congress â decided he was going to put Harriet Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill,â White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told CNNâs Wolf Blitzer. âWell, Wolf, he canât do that,â Conway argued, continuing, âPresident Trump cares very deeply about the American people and he has said, time and time again, if weâre going to do it, weâll replace one great man with another.â Less than a week after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin pointedly avoided voicing support for a $20 bill featuring Harriet Tubman, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing â the agency responsible for producing paper currency â released a statement saying âcurrent color and shading capabilities limit our ability to adequately depict [Harriet Tubman] on most forms of U.S. currency.â The statement went on to say that increased shading would make the bill âtoo darkâ and, therefore, more susceptible to counterfeiting.

183,CIA Documents Confirm Hitler Fled To Argentina After WW2,http://yournewswire.com/cia-hitler-argentina-ww2/,"Newly declassified CIA documents confirm that Adolf Hitler escaped Germany after World War II and took refuge in Argentina. The files confirm earlier FBI documents, which claim that the U.S. government knew the Nazi Fuehrer was alive and well, living in the Andes Mountains long after the war had ended. In 1955 the chief of the CIAâs Western Hemisphere Division (WHD) received a secret memo with the subject line âOperational: Adolf Hitler,â from the CIA station chief in Venezuela that contained proof Hitler was still alive in South America. Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: Interestingly, these revelations seem to confirm declassified FBI documents that also claimed sources had indicated that Hitler was indeed living in Argentina. While the official story sold to the global public is that Hitler died of suicide in the Fuhrerbunker, the actual truth may be vastly different from the popularized version of events. The acting CIA station chiefâs informants, CIMELODY, was contacted by a former SS trooper Phillip Citroen, who claimed to have been in contact with Hitlerâwho was living under the pseudonym Adolph Schuttlemayerâabout once a month in Colombia, while there on a trip from Maracaibo as an employee of the Royal Dutch Shipping Company. Citroen said that Hitler had left Colombia for Argentina around January 1955, and erroneously suggested that the statute of limitations for war crimes had passedâas it had been 10 years since the end of World War IIâand that the Allies could no longer prosecute Hitler as a war criminal. The CIA documents reveal that Citroen told CIMELODY that he had even taken a photo with Hitler, and provided a grainy picture that was included in the CIA memoâwith Hitler purported to be the man on the right. After reviewing the CIAâs files, the WHD chief reported that Citroen had only the year before reported that a colony of Nazis was present in Colombia that engaged in âidolatry of the Nazi past addressing him as âder Fuhrerâ and affording him the Nazi salute and storm trooper adulation,â in reference to Hitler himself. The station chief wrote the WHP chief again only days later to engage in further investigation of whether or not it really was Adolf Hitler. The HPD chief then incredibly made the decision to drop further inquiry, as he felt âenormous efforts could be expended on this matter with remote possibilities of establishing anything concrete.â A seemingly strange response considering the magnitude of the report and veracity of the sources credibility in that Citroen was a former Nazi himself. As The Free Thought Project previously reported: âSouth America did indeed play host to many fleeing Nazisâincluding sadistic doctor Josef Mengele, whose torturous experimentation of Nazi concentration camp prisoners eventually branched into the study of twins. Later, in a small town in Brazil, one in five pregnancies resulted in births of twinsâsomething Argentine historian Jorge Camarasa claimed in 2009 evidenced Mengeleâs handiwork following his escape from Germany.â Perhaps there is more to the story than a war weary public was led to believe in the wake of the devastation of WWII, and the truth lies somewhere other than what has became the official narrative of Hitlerâs death in the Fuhrerbunker with his brideâwith reality being much closer to an escape with may other Nazi war criminals to South America.",1
184,Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas,http://www.revolutions2040.com/edward-snowden-osama-bin-laden-still-alive-living-bahamas/,"Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas: Edward Snowden (the NSA whistleblower) has made another astonishing revelation. He apparently has documents that prove Osama Bin Laden is on the CIAâs payroll and currently living a luxury lifestyle in the Bahamas. In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), released various documents regarding government surveillance programs. This resulted in him being charged for committing several crimes. All of the charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Due to this and the fact he believed it was the correct decision to reveal the shocking extent of phone surveillance by U.S. intelligence agency, he had no choice but to flee. He currently resides in Russia, this is where he has be offered asylum for one year. Snowden has yet again provided a shocking piece of information. The Moscow Tribune reports that Snowden claims that Osama Bin Laden the infamous former leader of Al Qaeda, is in fact still alive and is in receipt of cash courtesy of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). âI have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIAâs payroll,â  Snowden claims. âHe is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.â Snowden claims the CIA faked the death of Osama Bin Laden. After reporting him dead, the man himself and his family were moved to a secret location in the Bahamas. âOsama Bin Laden was one of the CIAâs most efficient operatives for a long time,â Snowden claims. âWhat kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobodyâs looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.â NaijaPicks say that these documents that prove this controversial claim are featured in his 2015 book. Despite the fact Snowden says he was trying to help the citizens of America by releasing these documents, he is still classed as a fugitive in the USA. This is also despite approximately 168,000 people signing a petition calling for Snowden to be pardoned. This was rejected by the White House rejected on July 28, 2015. Whilst resident in Hong Kong, Snowden was interviewed by several journalists inside a secret location. He was asked why he left his own country, his reply to The Guardian was: âI donât want to live in a society that does these sort of thingsâ¦ I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded.â",1

The claims came after the Chinese moon rover allegedly couldnât find any proof of American landings on the Moon. The rover took thousands of photos and after analyzing them the Chinese discovered that thereâs no trace of these moon landings. Now the Chinese space program has launched a petition, already signed by 200 of its high-ranking officials, demanding explanation from the US government and the release of classified NASA information which will finally put an end to all the speculations and give definitive proof of the American moon landings. Or maybe it was just an elaborate hoax with the sole purpose to fool the world about its space program capabilities. Whatever the case they need to come forward and speak the truth. The petition has been signed by world-renowned nuclear engineer, Yury Ignatyevich Mukhin, and numbers of other prominent Russian engineers and ex-KGB agents. Theyâre all saying that the Russian government âhas always been aware of the situation since the early 1970sâ. The claims are favored by conspiracy theorists who have tried to convince the public for decades that the USA hasnât ever landed on the Moon.

187,Australia Becomes Worldâs Most Microchipped Nation,http://www.revolutions2040.com/australia-becomes-worlds-microchipped-nation/,"(YNW)   Australia Becomes Worldâs Most Microchipped Nation: Australia has become the first widely microchipped nation, with Australians readily parting with $150 of their own money to pay for âfashionableâ microchips under their skin â without stopping to think of the consequences. Mainstream media in the US has been waging a propaganda campaign trying to normalize the idea of microchips for humans, airing reports claiming that children will be microchipped âsooner rather than laterâ and that Americans will accept this because it will make their children âsafer.â But while Americans remain wary about the idea of microchips for humans, the campaign to normalize microchips has been so successful in Australia that people with RFID microchips permanently embedded in their bodies now consider them as âanother organ of the bodyâ and boast that they can use them as âloyalty cards in storesâ and âreceive discounts.â The only catch is that these slaves of fashion donât know exactly what has been put into their body. They also canât be sure who has access to their personal data. If history repeats, human microchips will go from being technology adopted for its âconvenience and safetyâ and then overnight will become mandatory for you and your family â or else. News.com.au reports: It may sound like sci-fi, but hundreds of Australians are turning themselves into âsuper-humansâ who can unlock doors, turn on lights and log into computers with a wave of the hand. Shanti Korporaal, from Sydney, is at the center of the phenomenon after having two implants inserted under her skin. Now she can get in to work and her car without carrying a card or keys and says her ultimate goal is to completely do away with her wallet and cards. âYou set up your life so you never have to worry about any password or PINsâ, she said.âItâs the same technology as Paypass, so Iâm hoping youâll be able to pay for things with it.â The microchips, which are the size of a grain of rice, can act like a business card and transfer contact details to smartphones, and hold complex medical data. Advocates claim that in the future microchips will even release medication into your body. Shanti has had some messages from conservative Christians on Facebook telling her sheâs going to hell, but the reaction has mainly been one of intrigue. âMy nana wants one,â laughs Shanti. âIâve had more opposition to my tattoos than Iâve ever had to the chip. My friends are jealous.â When the 27-year-old realized just how coveted the implants were, she set up a distribution service called Chip My Life with her husband, Skeeve Stevens. It costs between $80 and $140 depending on the sophistication of the technology, and (while you can do it at home) they work with doctors who charge $150 to insert the implant. âThey do minor surgery, Botox and so on,â says Shanti. âThey give you a local, an injection and a quick ultrasound to make sure itâs in place.â The biohacking couple both have RFID (radio-frequency identification) chips in their left hands and NFC (near-field communication) chips in the right. The implant is almost impossible to spot, leaving a mark as small as a freckle. Shanti is appearing at todayâs Sydney launch of cyborg-themed video game Deus Ex Mankind Divided alongside US implantable technology pioneer Amal Graafstra. Amal considers himself a guinea-pig for human augmentation, making headlines in the US last week with a prototype of the worldâs first implant-activated smart gun. He became one of the worldâs first RFID implantees in 2005, and has since founded an online store to sell the âat homeâ kits to people who want to âupgrade their bodyâ. Heâs written a book, spoken at TEDx and appeared in documentaries. âOn a psychological level, this is completely different to a smartphone or a Fitbit, because it goes in you,â he said. âYour kidneys are working hard but youâre not thinking about them, itâs not something you have to manage. âItâs given me the ability to communicate with machines. Itâs literally integrated into who I am.â He is aware of the ethical and security concerns but points this is simply a case of âcomputing in the body.â Rather than worry about people being forced to be microchipped, heâs now busy advocating for the rights of citizens who use them. He believes the destruction of the chip could in some cases classify as assault (as with a pacemaker) and other dangers might be governments forcibly extracting implants or data from them. âI want to make sure itâs treated as part of the body, like an organ,â he says. One firm in Sweden has allowed employees to choose chips over a work pass, with 400 taking up the offer, but Amal says he more often hears from interested individuals who want to try it out. âAt the moment, itâs mainly access â house, computer motorcycle. But in the future, thereâs the potential to use it for transit, payment. You could get rid of your keys and maybe your wallet.â Other uses might include children tapping to let parents know they are at school safely, refugees checking in at camps or women at shelters. It can share diet, exercise and sleep information with you and your doctor, and the next generation could even release medicine as and when you need it. For Shanti, adding an extra dimension to life is a childhood fantasy come true. âEver since watching movies like the Terminator, Matrix and Minority Report I wondered if we could actually live like that. I always wondered why we all werenât living as âsuper-humansâ.â",1
188,Dr. Gallo: âI Invented AIDS To Depopulate Humanityâ,http://www.revolutions2040.com/dr-gallo-invented-aids-depopulate-humanity/,"Dr. Gallo: âI Invented AIDS To Depopulate Humanityâ: Dr. Robert Gallo, the scientist credited with âdiscoveringâ the HIV virus in 1984, has admitted that he created AIDS in order to reduce the worldâs population.  In 1984, Gallo filed a U.S. patent application for his invention of the HIV/AIDS virus. Dailypost.co.za  reports: Normally, when a patent is filed and approved, as Dr. Galloâs was, anyone who uses the product or invention owes a royalty payment to the artificer. Thus, holding the intellectual property laws to their fullest interpretations, one must solely marvel why Dr. Gallo has yet to file a proceedings seeking to recover damages from the usage of his invention? As odd as this state of affairs could sound, it bears need for extra scrutiny. The scientific evidence is complete and compelling, the AIDS Virus is a designer bi-product of the U.S. Special Virus program. The Special Virus program was a federal virus development program that persisted in the U.S from 1962 until 1978â¦.. The U.S. Special Virus was then added as âcomplimentâ to vaccinum inoculations in Africa and Manhattan. Shortly thereafter the world was engulfed with mass infections of somebodyâs animal virus that differed from any illustrious human sickness, it was highly contagious and additional significantly, A review of the Special Virus Flow Chart (âresearch logicâ) reveals the United States was seeking a âvirus particleâ that might negatively impact the defense mechanisms of the system. The program sought to modify the ordination of the virus particle during which to splice in associate degree animal âwasting diseaseâ referred to as âVisnaâ. According to the Proceedings of the us of America, AIDS is an biological process, laboratory development of the peculiar Visna Virus, first detected in Icelandic sheep. Recently, American and world scientists ensure with 100 percent certainty the laboratory genesis of AIDS. This fact is more underscored once one reviews the âmultiply-splicedâ nature of the HIV âtatâ sequence and Dr. Galloâs 1971 Special Virus paper, âReverse Transcriptase of Type-C virus Particles of Human Originâ.Dr. Galloâs 1971 Special Virus paper is identical to his 1984 announcement of AIDS. Upon further review the record reveals that he filed his patent on AIDS, before he made the announcement with Secretary troubler. Earlier this year, Dr. Gallo conceded his role as a âProject Officerâ for the federal virus development program, the Special Virus. The Flow Chart of the program and the 15 progress reports are undeniable proof of the United Statesâ game to cull world populations via the unleashing of a stealing biological organism that may âwasteâ humanity. In light of this true genesis of the worldâs most divesting biological scourge, it is the u. s. that owes âroyalâ payments to the innocent victims. Each associated each victim of AIDS is worthy of a proper apology and a way of economic closure for an invention of death and despair, perpetrated by the United States. The eyes of the world are upon the overall Accounting Officeâs Health Care Team, under the direction of William J. Scanlon. Between 1964 and 1978, the secret federal virus program spent $550 million dollars of payer cash to create AIDS. It is now necessary to pay no matter it takes to dismantle associate invention that has junction rectifier to the best crime against humanity within the history of the globe.",1
189,Putin Issues International Arrest Warrant For George Sorosâ¦.. Dead or Alive,http://www.revolutions2040.com/putin-issues-international-arrest-warrant-george-soros-dead-alive/,"(The Real Strategy) Putin Issues International Arrest Warrant For George Sorosâ¦.. Dead or Alive Russia has officially declared that Billionaire George Soros is a wanted man in their country, citing him and his organizations as a âthreat to Russian national securityâ. Putin banned Soros from Russia last year due to the fact that Soros helped to nearly destroy the Russian economy in the early 1990âs. Matt Taibbi of the Rolling Stone said of Goldman Sachs six years ago: âThe first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that itâs everywhere. The worldâs most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. âIn fact, the history of the recent financial crisis, which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the suddenly swindled dry American empire, reads like a Whoâs Who of Goldman Sachs graduates.â Obviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs. Phil Butler puts it well when he says: âGeorge Soros has a finger in every political pie there is. If there is a crisis on our world, itâs a safe bet heâs had a hand in it.â One can say that Soros and Goldman Sachs are ideologically part of the same brotherhood. Their strategy is a little different, but the end result is the destruction of lives via the economic system (be it capitalism or socialism) and political manipulation. Thatâs why Soros seems to think that he is invincible. He thinks he can move the political and economic planet in a few blinks of an eye and no one can tell him to stop. In fact, he writes books such as The Alchemy of Finance. Soros thinks he can kill political stability throughout Europe and indeed in America with no challenge. Soros is certainly old, but he doesnât want to be obsolete. His organization has recently been caught conducting covert operations designed to destabilize Russia. Here is an interesting quote from the leaked files of Sorosâ Open Society Foundation: âOur inclination is to engage in activities and with actors that will understand and counter Russian support to movements defending traditional valuesâ¦Naming and shaming from us is problematic: we are also in the business of channeling money into other countries for political purposes.â",1
190,Planned Parenthood Founder Planned To âExterminate Black Raceâ,http://yournewswire.com/planned-parenthood-exterminate-black/,"Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in the world, is held up as a hero by liberals who claim she liberated women and ethnic minorities from lives of servitude. But the truth about Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood is a lot darker than liberals and ethnic minority leaders would have you believe. Sanger, hero of the contemporary left, was a self-described eugenist wanted to exterminate the black race, eradicate people with disabilities. Sanger admitted her entire lifeâs purpose was to promote birth control, but it was actually minorities she wanted to control â not the white race she belonged to. Her goal was to create a nation of âthoroughbredsâ â and that meant tricking ethnic minorities into killing their unborn. On blacks, immigrants and indigents: â...human weeds,â âreckless breeders,â âspawningâ¦ human beings who never should have been born.â  Margaret Sanger wrote in her book Pivot of Civilization, referring to immigrants and poor people. On sterilization & racial purification: Sanger believed that, for the purpose of racial âpurification,â couples should be rewarded who chose sterilization. (From Birth Control in America, The Career of Margaret Sanger, by David Kennedy, p. 117, quoting a 1923 Sanger speech.) Of course modern-day liberals are blissfully unaware that they have canonized a racist eugenicist, whose ideology was so extreme that Hitler claimed to take inspiration from her far-left pseudo-science. Liberal cognitive dissonance and censorship does not allow for anything based in fact for use in their echo chambers. Next time you hear a liberal speaking from their favorite position â the moral high ground â and praising Planned Parenthood, you might want to remind them of the organizationâs evil roots. Sanger espoused the thinking of eugenicists â similar to Darwinâs âsurvival of the fittestâ â but related the concept to human society, saying the genetic makeup of the poor, and minorities, for example, was inferior. On the extermination of blacks: âWe do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population,â she said, âif it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.â Womanâs Body, Womanâs Right: A Social History of Birth Control in America, by Linda Gordon On respecting the rights of the mentally ill: In her âPlan for Peace,â Sanger outlined her strategy for eradication of those she deemed âfeebleminded.â Among the steps included in her evil scheme were immigration restrictions; compulsory sterilization; segregation to a lifetime of farm work; etc. Birth Control Review, April 1932, p. 107 On adultery: A womanâs physical satisfaction was more important than any marriage vow, Sanger believed. Birth Control in America, p. 11 On marital sex: âThe marriage bed is the most degenerating influence in the social order,â Sanger said. (p. 23) [Quite the opposite of Godâs view on the matter: âMarriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled; but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.â (Hebrews 13:4) On abortion: âCriminalâ abortions arise from a perverted sex relationship under the stress of economic necessity, and their greatest frequency is among married women.â The Woman Rebel â No Gods, No Masters, May 1914, Vol. 1, No. 3. âThe most merciful thing that a large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.â Margaret Sanger, Women and the New Race (Eugenics Publ.

In 2017, Obamaâs image will replace George Washingtonâs.âWe thought about creating a new denomination for Obama, but George Washington has had plenty of time in the sun,âJohn Apple from the Federal Reserve said.âWeâve needed to change things up for a while now.âThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing has released several comps but a design has not been finalized. The Bureau will release all compositions in early 2016 and poll the American public letting them help decide which design works best.Many presidents were bandied about as the new face of the one-dollar bill including Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Reportedly, Reagan almost got the nod to replace Washington, but people within the Federal Reserve felt Obama brought a much needed multiracial mix to American currency.âObama being of mixed-race was probably what tipped things; however, we looked at overall accomplishments as well. Frankly, he [Obama] has done more for the betterment of this country than Reagan did, and he still has a year left. More importantly, the racial complexion of America has changed and putting Obama on the dollar bill really, really helps express that.âAn official republican response has not been issued, but Reserve leaders are confident that everyone will agree that this is a progressive step forward",1

He apparently has documents that prove Osama Bin Laden is on the CIAâs payroll and currently living a luxury lifestyle in the Bahamas.In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), released various documents regarding government surveillance programs. This resulted in him being charged for committing several crimes.All of the charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Due to this and the fact he believed it was the correct decision to reveal the shocking extent of phone surveillance by U.S. intelligence agency, he had no choice but to flee.He currently resides in Russia, this is where he has be offered asylum for one year. Snowden has yet again provided a shocking piece of information. The Moscow Tribune reports that Snowden claims that Osama Bin Laden the infamous former leader of Al Qaeda, is in fact still alive and is in receipt of cash courtesy of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).âI have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIAâs payroll,â  Snowden claims. âHe is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.âSnowden claims the CIA faked the death of Osama Bin Laden. After reporting him dead, the man himself and his family were moved to a secret location in the Bahamas.âOsama Bin Laden was one of the CIAâs most efficient operatives for a long time,â Snowden claims. âWhat kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobodyâs looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.âNaijaPicks say that these documents that prove this controversial claim are featured in his 2015 book.Despite the fact Snowden says he was trying to help the citizens of America by releasing these documents, he is still classed as a fugitive in the USA. This is also despite approximately 168,000 people signing a petition calling for Snowden to be pardoned. This was rejected by the White House rejected on July 28, 2015.Whilst resident in Hong Kong, Snowden was interviewed by several journalists inside a secret location. He was asked why he left his own country, his reply to The Guardian was:âI donât want to live in a society that does these sort of thingsâ¦ I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded.âSource : Unknown But Not Hidden;  Image Source: Awareness Act",1
193,"Charlottesville Killer Was Hillary Supporter, Funded By Soros",http://yournewswire.com/charlottesville-hillary-soros/,"The man accused of being a neo-Nazi and murdering a woman by deliberately driving into her during protests in Charlottesville is in reality a supporter of Hillary Clinton and member of Antifa in receipt of funding by George Soros, according to reports. James Fields, 20, of Maumee, Ohio, allegedly killed Heather Heyer, aged 32, and injured 19 others when he rammed his car into a group of protesters on Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia. Mainstream media is claiming Fields is a neo-Nazi and has conveniently produced photographs showing Fields standing with Vanguard America and carrying a shield bearing the groupâs insignia. But the mainstream media is actively suppressing information that proves Fields is actually a left-wing operative at the heart of a false flag designed to spark civil war, introduce martial law, and take away the rights of conservative groups to assemble peacefully. Police were ordered to stand down just before the incident, as confirmed by ACLU. âThis invited the violence the city used to shut down a court-permitted protest,â said Robert Barnes, a high-profile constitutional lawyer. Immediately after the car was driven into the crowd and James Field was identified as the driver and arrested, his social media accounts were put on lockdown and scrubbed of political content. His affiliation to Clinton and the dangerous far-left is being actively suppressed. There is only one winner in Charlottesville. His name is George Soros and he funds Antifa. The UniteTheRight rally was planned months in advance, proper permits were sought and granted, and the peaceful protest was going to plan. Then, due to political pressure from the left, the city of Charlottesville rescinded the permit a few days before the rally. This was a clear violation of the 1st Amendment. So UniteTheRight went to federal court and won. A federal judge ordered that the rally must go on and the rally-goers Constitutional rights be protected. But the left wasnât finished. The Democrat mayor and police department ordered the rally an âunlawful assembly,â and threatened to arrest everybody â once again, violating 1st and 9th amendment rights. Then things got bloody. George Sorosâs Antifa stepped up to the plate, unleashing chaos and hate as per their job description. The mainstream media is spreading lies and deceit to further the false flag, and attempting to deflect from their transparent agenda by railing angrily against President Trump for failing to say exactly what they want him to say (despite the fact Obama did not disavow Black Lives Matter after they destroyed Ferguson and Baltimore). Real footage captured by citizen journalists on the ground in Charlottesville proves that the mainstream media are peddling lies about the incident from the comfort of their air-conditioned ivory towers. The car crash is a sloppy false flag, designed to mislead, deceive and take away our rights. The following video, around 2 minutes in, shows the crash in real time, and shows Fieldsâ car being rammed from behind. The Charlottesville violence is far-left agitation at itâs worst. It is the culmination of violent rhetoric spewing from the mouths of Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch. In cahoots with George Soros, the failed presidential candidate and her cronies are attempting to stage a false flag to take away the rights of conservatives to lawfully organize rallies and assemble peacefully. Chaos and hate the order of the day, as the lawless ones march us towards a police state and a New World Order. While the real terrorists are allowed to roam free, we will be the ones imprisoned.",1
194,DHS Insider: CIA And Mossad Behind Washington DC Pedophile Ring,http://www.anonjekloy.tk/2017/02/dhs-insider-cia-and-mossad-behind.html,"ANON JEKLOY  6:34:00 PM   BREAKINGNEWS  , hotnewsanonymous[YNW] DHS Insider: CIA And Mossad Behind Washington DC Pedophile Ring:A DHS insider claims that the CIA and Mossad are secretly behind the cover-up of a Washington DC pedophile ring, using their knowledge of politicians involved to blackmail and further their political agendas.According to a new interview with a Department of Homeland Security agent, over one third of DC politicians are controlled by sexual blackmail, which the CIA and Mossad use to further the Deep Stateâs goals.Theinternationalreporter.org reports:Today, we have an exclusive interview with a special DHS insider who has answered some critical questions we have on PizzaGate.  Our insider prefers to call it PedoGate and what he told us blew our minds!We are so fortunate that members of the Intel community like our work and feel they can trust us. We have been trying to get to the bottom of PizzaGate for months and the answers we got from our DHS insider.Q. So, in the Intelligence community, how chaotic is the atmosphere now?A. In my 34 years of Governmental service, I have never seen anything like it.  Itâs the bifurcation of the entire intelligence apparatus.Q. It seems the intel community has it in for Trump â is this your feeling?A. There are many Trump supporters within the FBI.  The CIA, however,  is against Trump because Trump threatens to ruin their game in the middle east.Q. Can you elaborate?A. CIA and Mossad work in tandem with British intel.  The goal for the CIA was to replace Assad with a puppet and to topple Iran so we could access their oil.  Israel works closely with itâs âsisterâ, Saudi Arabia, to help this dark cause.Q.  So it seems like the intel community has it in for Trump. How can he protect himself?A. Trump has a tremendous opportunity here, but needs to circle wagons. The travel ban included 7 countries chosen by both Jared Kushner and Rudy. Why did it not include Saudi Arabia, or Pakistan, or Turkey or other countries that hate us? The seven nations mentioned were chosen by Israel, thatâs why. And the unspoken alliance of Israel and Saudi Arabia should be exposed. They are brother and sister. Jared Kushner needs to be careful with what he says and to whom. But, the biggest thing Trump can do is expose PedoGate via Sessions. Big names will go down hard, and it gets the blood suckers drained from the swamp. There are as many pedophiles on the Republican side as there is with democrats, but Trump is in a unique position to truly âclean up Dodgeâ, so to speak. I can tell you that what is in Anthony Weinerâs hard drive, and what videos exist via Jeffery Epstein, WILL BRING massive arrests â in time. Trumpâs legacy could be truly great if he was to purge the CIA, stop the extortion, prosecute the pedophiles and reinstate the death penalty for pedoâs convicted a second time.  Pedogate is his path to greatness.Q. How does Russia fit into all this?A.  The CIA and Israel are responsible for the creation of Isis. Isis was created specifically to weaken Iran and destabilize Syria. It worked for awhile until Putin shored up Assad and bolstered Iranian Qud forces. The real reason you see such anti-Russian fever from both Schumer and McCain, Graham and Feinstein, is because the operation has blown up in our faces.Q. Is Israel behind the anti Russian sentiment?A. Yes. Israeli intelligence is furious with Trump, and will do anything to keep Trump from working with Putin.  Understand that if Trump and Putin work together to defeat Isis, they are actually defeating a CIA/Mossad creation, and furthermore, Syria and Iran grow stronger, which the Saudis and the Israeliâs fear. Their goal was to divide Syria and ultimately destroy Iranâs regime. It is not just an oil grab, but a much bigger attempt at moving the chess pieces to allow Israel and Saudi Arabia to dominate the entire Middle East.Q. So they demonize Putin and try to tarnish the Trump administration?A. The Deep State is at war with both Trump and Putin. Understand that when Israeli intelligence hears âAmerica firstâ from Trump, they go apeshit. Israel has bribed, extorted and intimidated our politicians for decades and suddenly this upstart billionaire threatens to ruin everything.Q. You mention the word extort. Does that relate to Pizzagate?A. PedoGate is only a modern term associated with a long history of Pedo-blackmail connected to both Israel and the Intel community. There is a full court press to stop PedoGate from being looked at because if people knew the true motives behind the pedophilia epidemic, they would do more than march on Washington. They could actually seed a revolution, with the spark coming from decent American parents who want to protect their kids. Our politicians are compromised. The senior analyst nicknamed âFBI Anonâ alluded to this in his exchange with folks on 4chan and with you.Q. What do you mean compromised?A. Do you notice 2 central themes running through the MSM lately?  Those themes are âFear the Russiansâ and â#PizzaGate is fake newsâ.  Both tropes come from the same place.Q. Can you explain?A. How do we exert power?  Via fear. Do you ever wonder why both Democrats and Republicans fall all over themselves to kiss up to Israel? Odd, since Israel is the size of Rhode Islandâ¦ The fact is, many of our politicians â on both sides â have been compromised by CIA and Mossad for years. Itâs actually not admiration they are expressing for Israel, but fear. Notice Lindsay Graham and Chuck Schumer repeating the same salute when it comes to Israel. How does that even happen? The American people are finally seeing that there is no two-party system, but one big shadow Government pretending we have political dichotomy.Q.  So PedoGate is real and âtheyâ have to get Americans to disbelieve it?A. Let me explain how threatening PedoGate isâ¦ Who wins? Trump. Putin. Americans. Russians. The worldâ¦. Who loses? Israel, since they no longer can blackmail our politicians, the same goes for the CIA. The Shadow Government loses. But, the people win.Q. Can you give me specific instances of politicians being compromised by Israel?A. Sure. Lolita Island. Jeffery Epstein, a billionaire convicted of pedophilia received a soft sentence. His island was rigged with video recorders. Many politicians have been compromised. It was a Mossad/CIA operation. Contact ex-senior CIA CCS, Robert David Steele. Bob knows and has even spoken about this with numerous reporters.Q. So an ex-CIA senior agent named Robert Steele is on record saying Epsteinâs island was a honey trap to lure our most powerful politicians into a extortion scheme?A. Yes. There are videos of some of the most powerful players in the most humiliating positions. If this gets out, not only are the politicians ruined, but the extortion game is over and suddenly, the influence CIA and Mossad wield over Washington, is gone.Q. Wow ! Now its all making sense.A. Yes. lets continue this conversation later.Q. So I checked out Robert David Steele, and he mentions Chuck Schumer being on Lolita Island. So does FBI anon. Is that why Schumer is targeting Trumpâs cabinet picks?A. Connect the dots.Q. How many other politicians have been secretly extorted?A. One in three, roughly. Itâs not just the Island, its all of their activities. The reason #Pedogate terrifies the media, the CIA, the Israel Lobby, is because they are all part of this âshadow swampâQ. Former CIA agent, Robert Steele, says Mossad operated Lolita Island and CIA worked with them. Thatâs treason on all levels.A. Yes, and its espionage. Just as these leaks from the intel community regarding Flynn.  I expect that at some later moment, Trump will leak some of these videosQ. Wait. Trump has videos of politicians in âdelicateâ situations?A.  No, But the Intel community has them, and Trump has strong support among certain players in the community. Trump has said he wants to âthrow a spotlight on the cockroachesâ.Q. But Trump just met with Netanyahu and pledged the usual unbreakable bond with Israel.A. Theatre.  Netanyahu is desperate to both play Trump into attacking Syria,and hate Putin, and to convince him PedoGate is a conspiracy theory.Q. That is what Robert Steele says, as well. So, exposing the Pedophiles diminishes Israelâs influence in American politics and also changes the map in a critical mass way?A. The same media screaming âThe Russians are comingâ is the same media who says âPizzagate is fake newsâ Thatâs CIA and Mossad talking points.Q. How do social media giants like Facebook and Google fit in?A. Facebook and CIA are literally the same petri-dish. Google became a Deep State organ courtesy of Eric Schmidt.Q. Getting back to the Pedo stuff, FBI anon said in July of last year, that the Clinton Foundation sold secrets to foreign nations. Did they also engage in PizzaGate?A. There are videos of WJC that would destroy him. FBI anon leaked weeks ago, on purpose. There was a reason.Q. Ok, FBI anon gave Schumers initials, and Barnet Frank and others, but so far we have only seen low level arrests.A . FBI anon did a âbank shotâ. Thatâs a pool hall term we use. Ask Bob about it. FBI Anon rattled their cages as other DHS and local authorities rounded up all sorts of street-level human traffickers. The big arrests will come in time, but first the small fish are interrogated, and provide information that leads to larger fish. FBI Anon was firing a shot across the bow, much like you shake a beehive to infuriate the bees. Notice how blatantly hostile McCain, Schumer, Graham, and others are? It was what we call a âtargeted triggerâ.It worked. By long-kniving Flynn, they exposed their hand. Now, Trump has full executive powers to investigate the CIA and Mossad. Notice how there is sound and fury about âRussian influenceâ and utter silence on âMossadâ influence in our power structure?When FBI anon leaked in early July, the whole idea was to expose the Clinton Foundation,and to hint at the sale of âpeopleâ i.e. Pedogate. Look back at his exchange on 4chan. He is a gifted analyst, and knows just what stone to throw at Goliathâs noggin. By triggering the shadow Government, he helps citizen journalists ask the right questions and follow the right breadcrumbs, not the rabbit holes the Elite scum want you to follow.Now, PedoGate victims are speaking out on their experiences! You just had a story on some lady who went through having her family abused by California-Deep-State-sponsored terrorism. If folks knew that CPS in California is tied into a huge racket that kidnaps children from parents, they would realize just how sick this is. Foster homes, CPS, etcâ¦ all get paid well to jail parents and then snatch their kids away. These kids suffer abuse, and perpetuate the growing cancer called pedogate. Politicians who have pedophile tendencies are groomed for power, because they can be later extorted and controlled. Meanwhile, victims have no voice- until now. Suddenly, we have citizen journalism, and it will end up saving the people, in the end.I have to go, but please contact Robert David Steele, the former CIA agent we discussed. I am sure he would appear on your channel. You are providing a real service to the people and we hope you will continue to speak up for the regular folks who are concerned, rightfully, as to the state of our nation.

That is because the sharpest investigators from the best forensics colleges have detected a cover-up. Signs that the DNC is mired in this guilt all the way up to their neckties and pearl necklaces mean nothing to most liberals who just say, âit was proven as fake news.âWell, no it certainly was and is not! In fact, a paper trail has unveiled a new twist regarding the whole affair.Disobedient Media tells us today that âa report from America First Media Group appears to showâ that payments were made to a private security company called âCrowdstrikeâ and that these ominous payments âcoincided with the dates of two mysterious deaths.â That would be the deaths of Seth Rich (DNC staffer and likely leaker to Wikileaks) as well as âprocess server Shawn Lucas.âMany who care about justice remember the name of Rich, but few recall the odd facts surrounding the death of Lucas. He met his end âafter he attempted to serve former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz with papers regarding the DNC Fraud Lawsuit.âThe lawyers for the plaintiffs in that case âsought protection from the courtâ by âciting both Seth Rich and Shawn Lucasâ deaths, as well as that of Beranton Whisenant Jr. and others.âTo put this into perspective, most people have seen crime documentaries where the guilty party says, âno commentâ to questions like âdid you kill your best friend?â There is no doubt of the guilt when such answers are given to such easy questions, and this is basically the analogy that can be used to describe how citing such concerns highlighted this.America First Media Group shows that the first payment made was what they called âpreemptive measuresâ and occurred on May 5th, 2016. Whoever left his paper trail also later added to that a payment to Crowdstrike that totaled â$98,849.84â and that âtook place on July 11th.âThe report tells us that âthe relationship to this date happens to be the day after DNC Data Director of New Voter Registration Seth Rich was murdered. The final payment to date is August 3rd, 2016. This coincides with another murder in the District of Columbia. Shawn Lucas, who died on August 2nd of last year, was the DNC Process Server and close friend of Seth Rich.âWhile libs keep crying ""fake news"" and ""case closed,"" this paper trail proves that such is simply NOT the case.While libs keep crying âfake newsâ and âcase closedâ about the Seth Rich case, this paper trail proves that such is simply NOT the case.Are we seeing evidence of actual blood money RIGHT BEFORE OUR VERY EYES?Lucas and Rich were friends, a fact which must not be overlooked. If one of those two was suspected of telling the other anything that the DNC wanted to be left unsaid, according to the âJames Bondâ logic that we seem to be witnessing, they both would have to go.Thanks to the Atlantic Council, George âAmerica LASTâ Soros is tied to Crowdstrike, which is yet another strike against them. Also, Adam Carter has found reasons to suspect the firm as having a âpossible role in the creation of the Guccifer 2.0 persona and possible fabrication of Russian hacking in coordination with the DNC.â This is a lie which has haunted the current White House since day one.What we have here is a rare and vivid look into actual liberal corruption.CrowdStrike-DNCWith ties to George Soros vis the Atlantic Group, Crowdstrike already comes with a justified level of distrust.If for any reason anyone on either side of the aisle (love Trump or hate him) still thinks that there is no leftwing cover-up happening here: let us imagine that George W. Bush and his team had such a paper trail after a GOP leaker is murdered who was talking to Jullian Assange about a Republican scheme to steal the White House.Even with the facts that we have now, Bush would have swung from the highest tree that the media could have hung him from. Even if it was only half-true, the media circus would have savored the ratings talking about it nonstop. âA PAPER TRAIL OF DEATH FOR BUSHâ the headlines on CNN would read, would they not have?THAT is how one knows that there is a cover-up happening.Sources: Disobedient Media â Teddy Stick",1
196,"Virginia GOP Rep Turns Traitor, Newest Resolution Helps Muslims As Christians Excluded",https://conservativedailypost.com/virginia-gop-rep-turns-traitor-newest-resolution-helps-muslims-as-christians-excluded/,"Posted by Danny Abarno | Sep 22, 2017 | National SecurityRepresentative Barbara Comstock (R-VA) has proposed a bill that would make hate speech against Islam illegalThe United States legislators have continued to follow Europeâs path towards complete censorship. European lawmakers have long placed laws that forbid the use of hate speech and make the offenses legally extremely punishable. Congress is looking to do the same thing in the United States that would comments against certain minorities legally punishable. Representative Barbara Comstock (R-VA) has proposed a bill that would protect Muslims from Islamophobic comments and she is not alone as many in the House are hoping the bill gets through.The bill is designed to protect minorities from hate speech, a vague category of crime that seems only to protect minorities while the majority is subject to any criticism. It would not be surprising to find out that this bill would be supported by Democrats, as they make up the majority of support, but there are a few virtue signaling Republicans that think that limiting speech is a good thing.The Democrats and liberals in the United States have always sought the removal of free speech as it allows forces in control to silence any internal opposition that may be directed against them. Republicans should know better than to advance a bill that would take away someoneâs ability to criticize something, especially a religion.The rational side of Islam that takes place after free speech is destroyed in a country. If this bill is passed then the US government will enforce Sharia lawThe rational side of Islam that takes place after free speech is destroyed in a country. If this bill is passed then the US government will enforce Sharia lawThe bill also calls for new task forces to be created that would seek out and prosecute individuals who violate the proposed law.  This means that our representatives want to create secret police forces appointed by bureaucrats to carry out laws that prohibit the criticism of Islam. If one begins to think of religious police who come to silence or kill journalists, activists, or anyone who disagrees with Islamâs culture of domination then one would have the proper idea of the kinds of forces that are going to be appointed.These task forces already exist in Europe as many in the United Kingdom suffer from their own government prosecuting them simply for stating that child marriage is common in Islam. Child marriage, polygamy, and religious intolerance were not what built this great nation and to have our culture become irrelevant is not only unacceptable, it is treason. These representatives should feel ashamed of themselves for even suggesting religious police forces would be a good idea and somehow does not cross the line between church and state.By instating government forces to monitor and prosecute hate speech, the US government would be condoning the use of religious police. Saudi Arabian Religious police above are brutal and are able to carry out swift and unjust punishments on the spot.By instating government forces to monitor and prosecute hate speech, the US government would be condoning the use of religious police. Saudi Arabian Religious police above are brutal and are able to carry out swift and unjust punishments on the spot.AdvertisementUnfortunately, this bill looks like it was manufactured by Islamist political groups across the United States. These groups like CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood are huge international organizations with vast networks of associates and activists that work to undermine national governments in order to better establish Sharia law.They will influence public opinion by calling anyone who speaks ill of Islam an Islamophobic, even though Muslims constantly disrespect and call for the deaths of Jews, Hindus, Christians, and often times other Muslims. If this law is passed then it basically condone Sharia law in the sense that blasphemers can have a legal case brought against them.Once organizations and police forces across the nation are able to enforce laws against those who speak ill of Islam, it will grant a foothold to those who want other punished by Sharia as well. Citizens of the United States did not immigrate from around the globe just to have Sharia law dominant over their lives.This is the same Sharia law that oppresses women and religious minorities to conditions that violate all international human rights. This law can never be placed over the Constitution as even the tiniest foothold will allow Islam to spread and begin to control the lives of all Americans.If the US places Islam above the Constitution then it will allow Islam to punish anyone caught outside of Sharia law. This bill must be stopped.If the US places Islam above the Constitution then it will allow Islam to punish anyone caught outside of Sharia law. This bill must be stopped.America has always placed our most sacred right as the right to speak freely. This often times calls for people to listen to opinions they probably disagree with but nevertheless must be heard the same. It protects the rights of minorities to speak out against atrocities that are occurring as well as allows even the most outrageous political voices to be heard.It is placed above all other rights for a reason because our founding fathers knew the dangers associated of a religion tied to a government structure. Islam can not be placed above other religions as it will give it a place to legally prosecute any who violate Sharia law, a drastic violation of any Americanâs Constitutional rights.",1
197,Hillaryâs Campaign Appears As If Theyâre Backing Out Of The Debate,https://conservativedailypost.com/breaking-hillarys-campaign-now-backing-out-of-the-debate/?utm_source=Push&utm_medium=OneSignal&utm_campaign=Martin,"Posted by Martin Walsh | Sep 21, 2016 | Liberal Corruption, Statesâ RightsSick Hillary Trying To Get Out Of DebateThe long awaited presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is set to take place on Monday, September 26, 2016. As many have recognized, Hillaryâs health is withering away nearly as quickly as her chances of winning this election.In fact, Hillaryâs health has gotten so bad lately, she cancelled a major rally she had planned in North Carolina for Tuesday afternoon. Naturally, the Clinton campaign offered no response for why they cancelled an event, but we all know the reason.Hillary has also canceled several events after she collapsed at Ground Zero on 9/11. The campaign indicated that Hillary overheated, the flu, had pneumonia. She literally has so many illnesses and health problems, it is almost impossible to keep up with which sickness she has this week.On Saturday night, we all saw how pale, frail, and ghostly Hillary appeared at 10pm when she spoke about the New York City bombings. She appeared absolutely exhausted and unfit to stand strong for a country that desperately needs a leader during these tough times.Sleepy Hillary Too Tired To Face Trump In DebateNow, it has been reported by associates close to the Clinton campaign that Hillary is attempting to cancel the debate where she is set to face Donald Trump for the first time. She may argue health issues or something else that doesnât make sense, but she is working closely with her team to avoid having to debate in a few days.The sources argue that Hillary feels as if the game is too close right now, and she is trying to just ârun out the clockâ and stay as hidden as possible before Election Day. The sources argue there is simply too much heat on Clinton and she quite possibly is one or two bad stories away from being permanently beaten.The sources spoke on the terms of anonymity, but they have indicated that they will provide more information when it becomes available. They indicated that they clear her schedule for the rest of the week so that she can rest, but they still are concerned about the fact the Hillary will have to stand for hours during this debate.They are also trying to push for a âseatedâ debate with chairs as opposed to standing. This could get very interesting in the coming days as we monitor the situation.Whether Hillary participates in the debate or not is a moot point. We can all clearly see the Clinton campaign is literally imploding with under 50 days until the Election. The campaign is running from fire to fire, and they should all blame Hillary for carrying so much baggage, hiding so many lies, and keeping so many things secret.Things have gotten so bad that even Clintonâs spokesman canât even come up with answers for her failures. Watch him absolutely crash and burn in this interview from Wednesday morning. How pathetic is this?Clinton campaign literally starting to implode 48 days out. This is OURS to lose now. pic.twitter.com/q8uRwbuapoâ Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) September 21, 2016Hillary has been in public office for 30+ years, she has no one to blame other than herself for her failures.While we wait to hear from the Clinton campaign, we can clearly see that we are winning this election. The American people are uniting from all walks of life to ensure that this election isnât won by Hillary.Hillary spent $50,000,000 in August on negative ads against Trump and she still dropped in the polls by 5 percentage points. We are winning this election, but we cannot afford to let go of the lead. We have to continue to share articles and promote Donald Trump. This country needs Trump now more than ever, and the American people across the country are voicing their support.We are very close to winning the election and ending the Clinton Cartel from ruining this country any longer, but we cannot let up now. We need to win this by as much as possible so they cannot take it away from us.We will keep you posted whether or not Hillary drops out of the debate Monday, but either way, we can clearly see she is in full panic mode and is afraid to face Doanld Trump!",1
198,Does Hillary Clinton Have Kuru Disease From Cannibalism?,https://conservativedailypost.com/evidence-hillary-now-confirmed-to-have-kuru-disease-from-cannibalism-proof/,"Posted by Elliot Bougis | Nov 9, 2016 | Breaking NewsâThe steak tartare was a bad decision.âHere is what we know so far:First, Hillary Clinton clearly has serious medical problems and is receiving unknown or inexplicable treatments for it.Dr. Drew, a CNN favorite, had his show cancelled with days of expressing his concerns.Second, her health problems mainly manifest as speech problems, uncontrollable coughing, or inappropriate laughter, problems walking, and a bizarre tongue ulcer.Third, she is professionally and personally connected to Marina Abramovic, a bizarre performance artist, and therefore has a surprising number of connections to the occult and to the satanic art/magick ritual known as Spirit Cooking.Fourth, Spirit Cooking includes disturbing instructions to cut into oneâs own flesh, âeat the pain,â and mix bodily fluids like breast milk, urine, blood, semen, and even feces for âspiritualâ drinking.  Fifth, the usual assumption is that she has Parkinsonâs disease, or might simply be a functioning alcoholic who stumbles and acts out in public.But there is another possibility.According to Wikipedia, âkuruâ is a rare, incurable neurodegenerative disorder (aka, brain disease) which was prevalent among the Fore people Papua New Guinea in the 1950s and 60s. Kuru is a type of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, caused by prions, which cause abnormal folding of specific proteins mostly found in the brain. In this respect, kuru is very similar to Creuztfeldt-Jakid Disease (CJD), better known as âMad Cow Diseaseâ.The Rachel Maddow DiseaseDonât worry about the medical jargon; the point is that there is a very unpleasant disease called kuru that is transmitted by ingestion of human blood (specifically the âprionsâ in the blood). These prions then cause more and more deformities in the brainâs proteins over time, ultimately leading to death.â#ImWithHer â¦ #ImWitherâOn the left is a card from the 1990s role-playing game called âIlluminati,â which is debated to this day because many of its cards seems to predict current events in the Globalist Agenda.In any case, the term kuru derives from the Fore word kuria or guria (âto shakeâ), a reference to the body tremors that are a classic symptom of the disease. It is also known as the âlaughing sicknessâ due to the pathologic bursts of laughter which are a symptom of the disease. It is now widely accepted that kuru was transmitted among members of the Fore tribe of Papua New Guinea via funerary cannibalism. Kuru causes physiological as well as neurological effects that ultimately lead to death.Neurological disorders?Check!Bodily tremors?Check!Laughing fits?Check!Ritual consumption of human tissues?Check!In the first stage of kuru, victims exhibit unsteady stance and gait, decreased muscle control, tremors, and speech problems.In the second stage, the patient is incapable of walking without support and suffers ataxia and severe tremors.Furthermore, the victim is emotionally unstable and depressed, yet has uncontrolled sporadic laughter.In the final stage, the patient is incapable of sitting without supportâ¦â¦suffers severe ataxia, is unable to speak, is incontinentâ¦â¦has speech problems, is unresponsive to his or her surroundings, and develops chronic ulcerated wounds.A screenshot of Hillaryâs tongue during the DNC this summer.A chronic tongue ulcer.Ultimately, an infected person usually dies within three months to two years after the first symptoms, often because of pneumonia or pressure sore infection.Pneumonia?Why, yes, thatâs exactly the explanation that her campaign gave to the public after she froze up and collapsed in New York on 9/11!Hereâs one other visual oddity.An illustration of prions in action, causing tangled protein deformities.Am I only one this prion illustration reminds of a presidential candidateâs logo?Or, as one journalist noticed last yearâ¦âCanât spell âHillaryâ without âillâ!âIn pop culture, the zombie apocalypse in the video game Dead Island is blamed on an aggressive type of kuru that causes skin degeneration as well as psychotic rage.Ironically enough, some years ago, Hillary herself noted the connection between violent video games and cannibalism.Is any of this 100% conclusive? No, I admit that, of course. But it does remind us of two bits of wisdom.First, the outside gradually comes to reflect the inside of a person. Over time, our thoughts and our habits express themselvesâimpose themselvesâon our physical appearance and health. So if a person is filled with lies and dark thoughts for decades, it will manifest in her appearance. An internally corruptâor rottenâperson will inevitably show external, bodily corruption, as well.Second, we can run from our actions for a long time, but eventually the consequences catch up with us. If Hillary ever had ingested the âingredientsâ in Spirit Cooking, not even she is above the law of consequences.If nothing else, we as American should NOT elect someone with this many spiritual and medical problems.We must be wiser.We must elect Donald Trump to Make America Great Again!",1
199,"Head Official Makes FINAL CALL, Hillary Most Definitely Sick With THIS",https://conservativedailypost.com/head-official-makes-final-call-hillary-most-definitely-sick-with-this/,"Posted by Matthew Bernstein | Sep 15, 2016 | Liberal CorruptionHillaryâs Diagnosis Is InterestingHillary Clintonâs health scares have been extremely prevalent the past couple days. Even though the Clinton campaign has stated that she has pneumonia, there are people that think otherwise. In fact there is a claim that she might have Parkinsonâs disease.A Republican state representative for New Hampshire made the claim first, on his Facebook account. In fact there was a twitter post by a King Robbo that has evidence to this. âJUST BEFORE SHE COLLAPSED! Her aid asks her to âSqueeze My Fingersâ A neurological test! NOT PNEUMONIA! â¦âNow there is more evidence for this. Daniel Tamburello, the co-chair of the Veterans For Trump group, has explained that his father had Parkinsonâs and pneumonia is common for people who suffer from it.âThey may have admitted HRC has pneumonia, but thatâs not WHY she has pneumonia. I believe she has pneumonia caused by Parkinsonâs disease.âHillary Clinton delivers the keynote address at the 18th Annual David N. Dinkins Leadership and Public Policy Forum at Columbia University, in New York, April 29, 2015. AFP PHOTO/TREVOR COLLENS (Photo credit should read TREVOR COLLENS/AFP/Getty Images)There Are Many People That Believe That Hillary Clinton Might Have Parkinsonâs DiseaseTemburello created a Facebook post detailed what he knows about the disease.âMy Dad has had Parkinsonâs since 1989, so I know a bit about the disease. Hillary has been rumored to have Parkinsonâs for some time, as one of the theories to what ails her. (Personally I would surmise it is more than one illness).âWhile not as educated as a doctor, Tamburello has probably talked to doctors over the past 25 plus years, so he does know what to suspect. Since it was a loved one that has had it, you can be assured that Tamburello is going to pay special attention.âIt has now been admitted she has pneumonia. Pneumonia is one of the most common secondary conditions that occurs, and is a high degree secondary issue complicating Parkinsonâs patientsâ health that causes eventual mortality â again, very common to have Parkinsonâs patients die of pneumonia.âTop Dems Working To Talk Clinton Into ResigningClinton Has Pneumonia Which Is A Common Secondary Condition From Having Parkinsonâs DiseaseSince he has been dealing with a family member having Parkinsonâs for over 25 years, he has probably heard all of this before. Again even though he is not a doctor, he probably has paid close attention to what has been said to him.Why do a lot of people who have Parkinsonâs die of pneumonia? Well Tamburello answers that as well. âThe reason is a lack of being able to control the âvalveâ on your throat that prevents water from going into your lungs when drinking.âEveryone has experienced this before. When you drink something and then suddenly start coughing and hacking, it is usually because you tried to take a breath at the same time that you were swallowing. Most people refer to this as âgoing down the wrong pipe.âTamburello continues on in his post. âThis in a combination with the recent fondness of mumus, makes me think she is concealing a deep brain stim battery pack that counters her tremors from Parkinsonâs (my dad has this battery pack too).âWell that would explain why you never see Clinton shaking, if she does have this. After all that is one of the more noticeable symptoms of Parkinsonâs disease is the shaking.I Think We Know Who Was Behind ThisYou Never See Clinton Shaking, And There Could Be A Reason For ThatAdvertisementTamburello finished his post by saying, âThey may have admitted HRC has pneumonia, but thatâs not WHY she has pneumonia. I believe she has pneumonia caused by Parkinsonâs disease.âHe offers some evidence, and it could be a reasonable claim. However it appears that his Facebook post was removed. Why would it be removed? Well there are two basic options on why that would happen. The first reason is that it could be true and they donât want people knowing, and the second reason is that Facebook is actively doing what it can to censor any and all anti-Clinton posts.Facebook has a history of trying to censor right wing ideas. After all their trending news team was fired because of that specific reason.Facebook Has A History Of Censoring Conservative News, Especially In The Trending News AreaWell there is more evidence for the first case. After Tamburello put his post on Facebook, people on Twitter started looking at the footage of Clintonâs collapse. And they started supporting his claim. Some of the users pointed out that her doctor did the âsqueeze my fingers test.âThis specific test is a common way to determine neurological health. And furthermore, they use it to diagnose Parkinsonâs disease. So all this evidence is going around that supports the claim that Clinton might have Parkinsonâs disease.Now naturally her personal doctor had released a statement that denied these claims. âSecretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies. On Friday, during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough, she was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at this morningâs event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.âWell of course her doctor is going to say that. But it still doesnât answer why someone who was helping her was telling her to âsqueeze my hand.â And considering that the âsqueeze my fingers testâ is a common way to diagnose the disease, people are going to become very suspicious.Hillary Knows She Is Guilty, Time To Put Her AwayThere Is A Lot Of Evidence In The Theory That Clinton Might Have Parkinsonâs DiseasePeople were already wondering about Clintonâs health since she had failed to tell everyone that she had pneumonia in the first place. This is only going to pester her some more until she actually releases her medical records.Share this article to show that the democratic presidential nominee might actually have Parkinsonâs disease. With all the evidence that someone who has seen and dealt with the disease for over 25 years, and considering that someone who was there told her to âsqueeze my fingers,â which is a common neurological test, it isnât completely out of the question to say that she has it.",1
200,BREAKING: NFL FINES PITTSBURGH STEELERS $1M EACH FOR SKIPPING NATIONAL ANTHEM,http://globalpoliticsnow.com/breaking-nfl-fines-pittsburgh-steelers-1m-skipping-national-anthem/,"Donald Trump must have really gotten through to the NFL! After he tweeted on Sunday shaming owners for catering to PC culture while allowing players to disrespect our flag, our country, and our national anthem, everyone fell in line.The Pittsburgh Steelers thought it would be safe to take âtaking a kneeâ to a whole new level by hiding in the locker room while the National Anthem played and everyone elseABC showed reverence for OUR country but they didnât count on it being extremely costly. reports that:The entire Pittsburgh Steelers team did not participate in the national anthem ceremony prior to their game with the Chicago Bears this afternoon.As the âStar-Spangled Bannerâ played at Soldier Field in Chicago at the start of the game at noon local time, the Steelersâ sideline was virtually empty.Steelers coach Mike Tomlin told a CBS Sports reporter that his team would stay in the locker room during the anthem.âWeâre not participating in the anthem today,â Tomlin said, adding that the action was ânot to be disrespectful to the anthemâ but to remove the team âfrom this circumstance.ââPeople shouldnât have to chooseâ whether to kneel or stand during the anthem, he said. âIf a guy feels a need to do something he should not be separated from his teammate who chooses not to.ââSo weâre not participating today,â he said. âThatâs our decision.âIt was a bad decision. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who donated to Donald Trumpâs election campaign, announced shortly after the game began that every player who âprotestedâ the National Anthem and showed âimmense disrespect to our nationâ would be fined a cool million dollars.âItâs one thing to protest, itâs another thing to be blatantly disrespectful to those who have served our country,â Goodell said, noting that âthis absolutely should not have happened on Veteran Appreciation Day at Heinz Field.âGoodell says that going forward, the National Anthem will be âa time of reverence, and players will be required to treat it as such.âThe NFL has acted disgracefully recently, but as usual Donald Trump (and America) wins.",1
201,Celebrities To Make 'Total Hollywood Strike' Unless Trump Resigns,https://www.clear-politics.com/2017/07/27/celebrities-make-total-hollywood-strike-unless-trump-resigns/,"We are all well aware that most of the Hollywood stars support the liberals and hate Donald Trump. Even before he took the office, it was more than obvious, as some even said that they will leave the country rather than have Donald Trump as a President. Just one of their hilarious acts.And lately, they are threatening to make a massive, all-around Hollywood strike if President Donald Trump does not quit. They have described Hollywood as the base of the entire modern American culture, and claim to be representing all of the humanity.Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us, not the other way around,  stated a spokesperson.Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood, starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props, movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops.Rosie ODonnell, Debra Messing, Ed Asner and Michael Shannon are among the most assertive people who are supporting the idea and calling the people to protest.No! In the Name of Humanity We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America! reads a full-page ad placed in the New York Times on Wednesday by the group Refuse Racism. Donald Trump, the President-elect, is assembling a regime of grave danger, the ad says.Millions of people in the US and around the world are filled with deep anxiety, fear, and disgust.Our anguish is right and just. our anger must now become massive resistance  before Donald Trump is inaugurated and has the full reins of power in his hands.UConservative informs that some of the celebrities are calling for an all-out strike.Hollywood is, simply put, the base of the entire modern American culture. It is the foundation of the country, so to speak, the glue thats holding it together. And think about what happens when you destroy the foundation of a house. It comes crashing down, right?Well, thats exactly whats going to happen to America unless Donald Trump realizes how real the danger of that actually is, and chooses to step down as President of his own free will. And while were on the subject, between you and me  nobody wants Hollywood to stop doing its thing, but this is a necessary move.Besides, its not like the billionaire-businessman-turned-president hasnt ventured into movies in his day, right? So, hell understand firsthand whats going to happen if Hollywood goes to strike. Without the work of Hollywood and the lifestyle promoted by it, there will literally be no more America to rule for Trump. So, in effect, its not us that are going to force Donald Trump to resign his office; its the people of America who are going to make him do it, because the Gods honest truth is  without Hollywood, there is no America. Its like trying to run Nazi Germany without Hitler at the forefront  it just becomes pointless, the spokesperson summed up.",1

Hersh said in a recent phone interview that the FBIs cyber unit found conclusive evidence on Seth Richâs computer that he had leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks shorty before his untimely death: [The DC police took Seth Richâs computer, but couldnât get past his password.] So they call the FBI cyber unit. The Feds get through [the password-protection on Richâs computer], and this is what they find. This is according to the FBI report. What the report says is that â some time in late spring or early summer â he [Rich] makes contact with WikiLeaks. Thatâs in his computer. They [the FBI] found what he [Rich] had done was he had submitted a series of documents â of emails, of juicy emails â from the DNC. By the way, all this shit about the DNC, where the hack, it wasnât hacked â¦ He [Rich] offered a sample, an extensive sample, Iâm sure dozens of emails, and said I want money. [Remember, WikiLeaks often pays whistleblowers.] Later, WikiLeaks did get the password. He [Rich] had a dropbox, a protected dropbox, which isnât hard to do. They got access to the dropbox. Thatâs in the FBI report. He also let people know with whom he was dealing â¦ the word was passed, according to the FBI report, âI also shared this box with a couple of friends, so if anything happens to me, itâs not going to solve your problemâ. But WikiLeaks got access, before he was killed. I have a narrative of how that whole fucking thing began.   Itâs a [former CIA director John] Brennan operation.

From recently, sadly, the list has one more name on it.According to Infowars, an ex-Haitian government representative who was supposed to reveal more on Clinton Foundation fraud and violation during the following week was discovered dead in Miami, and as already mentioned, under suspicious circumstances. When he was found dead, Klaus Eberwein had only 50 years.The editorial reports that the reason of the death is a gunshot to the head and this case is officially considered a suicide. Eberwein had stated that he feared for his life as he was louder regarding the illegal and unconstitutional things which were happening in the Clinton Foundation.The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace, -he stated while protesting in front of Clinton Foundations Manhattan office previous year. This Tuesday, Eberwein was expected to testify in front of the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. In the testimony, he was supposed to show how the Clinton Foundation funneled funds raised in a form of Haiti earthquake donations from donors from all around the world.His relatives, the close family, and his friends all agreed that he would not commit a suicide.Its really shocking. We grew up together; he was like family,  stated Gilbert Bailly, Eberweins friend.",1
204,Bill Clintons Health Condition Update,https://www.clear-politics.com/2017/04/29/bill-clintons-health-condition-update/,"According to some sources close to the Clinton family, Bill Clinton is facing some tough situations that are going to make his next week very hard.It looks like his family and some members of the Rodham clan have been filing into Little Rock all week where Bill is being bedridden at the residence connected with his library.Authors Darwin Porter and Danforth prince expose some pretty big stuff in an article in The Political Insider. It goes like this:In their new book, Bill & Hillary: So this is that thing called love, the authors interview Clinton insiders who claim that Bill slept with so many women that Hillary Clinton has repeatedly forced him to get an HIV test from the doctor. This is because the former President favored unprotected sex.And while the first tests came back negative, HIV and AIDS might explain an ongoing mystery. Over the years, both Clintons have kept their medical records a secret. Clinton has explained his rapidly changing appearance to his heart surgery and new diet but he has looked increasingly thin and weak at Hillary campaign rallies.If they are booking for rooms the only logical explanation is that are preparing themselves to have to stay for a funeral. This family stated that they do not want any state burial or national ceremony if anything happens to both of them in the time when Trump is president as they fear of what Trump is going to say during the process. One spokesman for the Clinton family said:Donald Trump is mean and vindictive. If something were to happen to one of the Clintons, he could demand to speak at a national service and who knows what kind of disrespect would come out of his childish mouth.",1
205,MIT Researchers: Global Warming Data Is âComplete Bunkâ,http://yournewswire.com/mit-global-warming-data-bunk/,"A new peer reviewed report on global warming concludes that key data relied upon to give us temperature measurements around the world is âcomplete bunk.â According to scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), key metrics such as the Global Average Surface Temperature (GAST), the NOAA, and HADLEY confirms what Trump has been saying for years â that man-made global warming does not exist. SHFTPlan reports: In this research report, the most important surface data adjustment issues are identified and past changes in the previously reported historical data are quantified. It was found that each new version of GAST has nearly always exhibited a steeper warming linear trend over its entire history. And, it was nearly always accomplished by systematically removing the previously existing cyclical temperature pattern. This was true for all three entities providing GAST data measurement, NOAA, NASA and Hadley CRU. As a result, this research sought to validate the current estimates of GAST using the best available relevant data. This included the best documented and understood data sets from the U.S. and elsewhere as well as global data from satellites that provide far more extensive global coverage and are not contaminated by bad siting and urbanization impacts. Satellite data integrity also benefits from having cross checks with Balloon data. The conclusive findings of this research are that the three GAST data sets are not a valid representation of reality. In fact, the magnitude of their historical data adjustments, that removed their cyclical temperature patterns, are totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data. Thus, it is impossible to conclude from the three published GAST data sets that recent years have been the warmest ever âdespite current claims of record setting warming. Finally, since GAST data set validity is a necessary condition for EPAâs GHG/CO2 Endangerment Finding, it too is invalidated by these research findings. (Full Abstract Report) Thegatewaypundit.com reports: Fulfilling a key campaign promise, President Trump shocked the world by pulling out of the Paris agreement. Axiosâ Johnathan Swan was the first to report the President would pull out of the agreement. On May 31st, Axios reported: President Trump has made his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the decision. Details on how the withdrawal will be executed are being worked out by a small team including EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Theyâre deciding on whether to initiate a full, formal withdrawal â which could take 3 years â or exit the underlying United Nations climate change treaty, which would be faster but more extreme. Why this matters: Pulling out of Paris is the biggest thing Trump could do to unravel Obamaâs climate legacy. It sends a combative signal to the rest of the world that America doesnât prioritize climate change and threatens to unravel the ambition of the entire deal. The other outliers: The only other two countries that arenât supporting the deal are Nicaragua and Syria. How it happened: A letter from 22 Republican Senators (including Mitch McConnell) that called for a clean exit had reinforced Trumpâs instincts to withdraw, and the president had been telling confidants over the past week that he was going to pull out. Itâs no surprise that members of the liberal establishment shifted into meltdown mode following the decision, with Hollywood director Michael Moore and former President Obama being the most vocal. As per The Hill: Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore blasted President Trumpâs decision Thursday to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, calling it âa crime against humanity.â âThis admitted predator has now expanded his predatory acts to the entire planet,â Moore tweeted. âUSA to Earth: Fâ YOU,â the filmmaker added in other tweets. âAmerica First! Earth Last! My name is Michael Moore. I am an American. And I live in a Rogue State.â Obamaâs statement was as follows: A year and a half ago, the world came together in Paris around the first-ever global agreement to set the world on a low-carbon course and protect the world we leave to our children. It was steady, principled American leadership on the world stage that made that achievement possible.  It was bold American ambition that encouraged dozens of other nations to set their sights higher as well. And what made that leadership and ambition possible was Americaâs private innovation and public investment in growing industries like wind and solar â industries that created some of the fastest new streams of good-paying jobs in recent years, and contributed to the longest streak of job creation in our history. Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future.  And for the nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale. The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created.  I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack.  But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; Iâm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet weâve got. But of course, like all Champagne Socialists, their credo is âdo as I say, not as I do,â with Obama jacking up his carbon footprint when abroad. Who could forget Obamaâs massive convoy during a recent speaking gig in Milan? The Independent Journal Review reported: Former President Barack Obama traveled to Italy this week to make a speech on climate change at the âSeed & Chips: The Global Food Innovation Summitâ in the city of Milan. It seems like Obama has taken a page out of Leonardo DiCaprioâs book of âdo as I say, not as I doâ and took a private jet to Milan. Not only that, he had a 14 car convoy to get into the city, which also included protection from above with a helicopter. It doesnât end there. According to The Daily Mail, 300 police officers were used to protect the former president. The fleet of 14 included multiple SUVs, police cars, and sedans â not to mention a few motorcycles. Hereâs another look at the convoy: While in Milan, Obama also met with former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who was a close partner during their respective times in office.",1
206,New Financial Scandal Leads To James Comey,https://www.clear-politics.com/2017/06/08/new-financial-scandal-leads-james-comey/,"According to the newest evidence, James Comey was appointed as the director of the FBI, by former President Barack Obama, only because he wants to hide the corruption of the Clinton family.Comeys brother, Peter who works as an executive at the law firm which is responsible for the filling of the Clinton Foundation taxes is maybe the most obvious proof of the connection between Comey and the former First Family.Obama has the whole trust in Comey that he will not target the deep state that he himself is a part of and that is going according to plan.The Federalist Tribune reported that:Comey was the deputy special counsel for the Senate committee investigating the Whitewater scandal in 1996, in which many people were arrested and charged with over 40 crimes, but the Clintons were not. Comey decided he would not prosecute Hillary, even though he acknowledged that she obstructed the investigation and destroyed evidence. Since that, for 23 years he has been repeating the same and he has been rewarded handsomely for enforcing a two  tiered justice system where the political elite live free from consequence. In 2005 he was hired as the General Counsel for Lockheed Martin  the largest recipient of contracts from the Department of Defense. Comey received over $6 million before leaving the corporation in 2010.Right after this, Comey was hired as a partner of the Clinton Global Initiative and received around 17 contracts from the State Department at the time when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.It is more than clear that Comeys career consists of giving to receive relationships with every person he had contact with. Especially the giant corporations and the globalist political elite. Donald Trump did a good thing by removing him from his position.",1

Something like this has never happened in our history.After this request was made, Judge Marmon Watson agreed to it and let the body of Vince Foster be dug out from its grave for the sake of a detailed autopsy by a work crew in Fairfax, Virginia.This came a few days after the intelligence services found additional evidence for the case in which a murdered reporter had a letter which had written on it if anything happens to me The letter was delivered to his publication and the most interesting thing about it was that it included Presidential candidate and former State of Secretary Hillary Clinton in an old crime of hers. This happened right after Vince Foster committed a suicide.His body was removed from the cemetery and is now headed to the Naval Hospital in Norfolk for an autopsy to clear his suspicious death.Because this subject is very sensitive, South Carolina Representative Trey Gowdy and all the other federal prosecutors keep all information connected to his case top secret.From the Washington Post:Depressed and losing sleep after a few months in the White House, Vince Foster became convinced that the turmoil surrounding his work for President Clinton would never stop. Hed already been the subject of a scathing newspaper editorial that had raised questions about his long association with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and his name kept appearing in White House controversies.",1

209,TRUMP IS VINDICATED: RIGGED Poll Plans Found In Podesta Emails,http://dcgazette.com/2016/rigged-poll-plans-found-podesta-emails/,"Donald Trump says that the election system is rigged.  Guess what.  Heâs right.In the battle for the mind of the American voter, not much is used more often than polls.  When building up a winner, it is vital to make it LOOK like one side or the other is winning.  No one wants to be associated with a loser, so part of the publicity strategy is to create the image that one side or the other is winning or losing.In order to make it look like Democrats, in particular, are winning, the coalition of people that includes John Podesta and his tribe of Hillary Helpers came up with a way to make the polls, at least, appear to have their candidates up.  Itâs called oversampling, and the method is used to plump up percentages.  From Zero Hedge via The Gateway Pundit.âFor all of you out there who still arenât convinced that the polls are âadjustedâ, we present to you the following Podesta email, leaked earlier today, that conveniently spells out, in detail, exactly how to âmanufactureâ the desired data. The email starts out with a request for recommendations on âoversamples for pollingâ in order to âmaximize what we get out of our media polling.âI also want to get your Atlas folks to recommend oversamples for our polling before we start in February. By market, regions, etc. I want to get this all compiled into one set of recommendations so we can maximize what we get out of our media pollingâ¦.That particular email is accompanied by a guide that tells of specific over sampling strategies PER STATE.  For example, in Florida, sampling first happens in Orlando and Tampa where the people are more friendly to Democrats.  Arizona oversamples with Hispanics.  The idea is to make the candidate more popular than he or she really is.Reverse strategies are used to bring down the opponent.  Sneaky, huh?The Podesta emails have been a revelation, but also have proven so many people correct when we looked at the polls and then empirical evidence in the way of crowd size and concluded that there was no way they could both be right.  The battle is on for your mind, and polls are being used as a weapon in that war.  Donât fall for it.",1
210,"Clinton Green Screen Again In NC â Points, Waves To Blank Wall, Not On Cell Phones",http://dcgazette.com/2016/clinton-green-screen-nc-points-waves-blank-wall-not-cell-phones/,"Since Hillary Clinton is at risk of a campaign-ending health issue manifesting itself in public every time she gets out of her safe-space, the cocoon of her Secret Service and the van sheâs hauled around in, sheâs taking precautions. Just as she did in Reno a couple of weeks ago, Clinton has enlisted the use of a green screen to fake the appearance of a crowd and the different backgrounds of a highly manipulated âmanifestation.âHer natural instincts lean towards deception so for her there are no integrity issues to contend with, just the usual ones of not getting caught in the middle of a lie, or having another couple of lies prepared for when the first ones are discovered.Her audience, wherever they are, are not in the same location as the liar who wants to be president. Just as in Reno, itâs clear that the displays on the cell phone screens do not depict the same background or the candidate as she passes in front of them.There is that old adage about vampires or witches not showing up in mirrors. Perhaps since Mrs. Clinton is both sheâs having that same effect on cell phone displays. That doesnât explain her strange behavior, turning around an waving to a blank wall, now adorned with the familiar red and white vertical stripes. She even does one of the convulsion-evoking open-mouthed points that both her and her husband regularly perform as a way of recognizing the adoring peasants in attendance.The wall probably wasnât too impressed with the recognition it got. Clinton clearly didnât understand where the fake audience was going to be later inserted and she couldnât just be cropped out. People might think she had collapsed or had one of her coughing fits. They left it in and it was noticed.Sheâs going to discovered no matter how she tries to hide it, what type of deception she tries to employee. Although there arenât many folks attending her rallies, thankfully the ones that do, or the ones that are made to appear that they do, brought their cell phones.Look for future fabricated events to be âphone-free,â for the safety of the audience, or whatever kind of justification they come up with to protect their flawed candidate from exposure. Maybe phones are a source of dehydration now, canât have them around this frail little jewel, can we?",1
211,"Another Obama Iran Lie â Ransom Full $1.7 Billion, Half Before Release, Half After",http://dcgazette.com/2016/another-obama-iran-lie-ransom-full-1-7-billion-half-release-half/,"Thereâs a reason why the Obama regime had problems with specifics on the balance of $1.3 billion what they said was paid to Iran after the original $400 million ransom had been paid. Thatâs because the ransom story, as with everything else the Democrats, particularly Obama and Clinton say, looks much less like the truth and a lot more like an attempt at a cover up.We were told by Obama, Kerry and State Department Spokesman Kirby that the $400 million was not a ransom. It was an assertion which they later were forced to admit was a lie. Now the lie about the ransom lie, that was part of the greater Iran deal lie turns out to have also been â a lie.The later payment didnât exist because the original ransom was for the full amount, all $1.7 billion of terrorist mad money was paid in exchange for the four hostages.The regime admitted to Congress on Tuesday that the money laundering styled cash transfer to Iran consisted of $1.7  billion which was arranged through Swiss banks and delivered by the US to Tehran.Representatives of the State, Defense and Treasury Departments held the private briefing to congressional staff who entered the meeting believing they were simply being updated regarding the $400 million. The original $400 million payment for hostages exchange was conducted on January 17th.We are now learning that also on the 17th, as well as January 19th and 22nd, money was sent to Iran by way of Swiss bank accounts. So half of the $1.7 billion, it would appear, was paid up front and the other half soon after their release, within five days.Briefers admitted, âThe cash payments were four times what has been disclosed and they went through Swiss banks on their way to the Iranians,â and indicated that the cash payments were made because Iran was desperate for foreign currency after years of Western sanctions.According to one source, âThey said the payments needed to be viewed in the political context. First the Iranian nuclear deal was going through, second the Iranian economy was in a difficult state and third the Iranians were in need of foreign currency.âThe source also noted the briefersâ use of the Clinton strategy, citing an inability to remember when asked who requested the cash.",1

Although the story is still unconfirmed, this is just one of many instances where Trump has helped the less fortunate regardless of race or gender. The mainstream media are usually busy portraying Trump as a racist, bigot, or chauvinist. But Trump boasts a long and documented history of helping out â because itâs the right thing to do.The homeless black woman reveals that, for eight years, she has been living in the Trump Tower for free. She says that she originally trespassed her way in before squatting in an empty room for the night. Police arrived the next day to address the situation. She was told she must leave the premises â or she would be subject to arrest.âWhen I told them I would not go, they contacted Mr. Trump over the phone and he came down here. Instead of evicting me off the property, he said that I can stay and itâs been eight years Iâve been here,â she revealed. âNot only did he not evict me off the property, he made sure that I ate three meals a day by room service and that I get a delivery of fresh flowers every week.âThe woman goes on to express a great displeasure with the way the media portrays Trump as a bad person. She insists that if it werenât for Trumpâs generosity she would be homeless, in the streets, and most likely dead. The woman was never asked to pay a dime throughout the duration of her stay at the tower. âDonald Trump is not a bad guy, heâs a wonderful wonderful man, and everything Iâm telling you today is true,â she concludes.Trump treated his female employees very wellTrumpâs female employees believe he is a champion of women as well as the less fortunate. Many of those who worked closely with trump say he was far ahead of his time for providing career advancement for women. Trumpâs companies have promoted women in otherwise male-dominated industries, granting them entry into a new playing field.Trump often told the female employees he worked with that he values women who can stand their ground in both legal battles, and on construction sites. Barbara Res was in charge of the Trump Towerâs 1980 construction. She recalls Trump telling the female employees that âmen are better than women, but a good woman is better than 10 good men.âSources:InfoWars.comWashingtonPost.com",1
213,"New EPA rules will cost Americans $3,080 each",http://www.naturalnews.com/2016-12-08-new-epa-rules-will-cost-americans-3080-each.html,"(Natural News) New EPA rules are being implemented on heavy trucks which has boosted the 10-year regulatory burden on America past the $1 trillion mark. 75 percent of that cost was imposed by the Obama administration. New analysis from American Action Forum shows that the cost amounts to an annual cost of $540 per person, or a one-time charge of $3,080.âIn other words, each year every person, regardless of age, in the nation is responsible for paying roughly $540 in regulatory costs. These burdens might take the form of higher prices, fewer jobs, or reduced wages,â said AAFâs Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at the watchdog group.President Obama is scrambling to lock in several new environmental regulations prior to leaving office. Obama has shattered the record for the amount of regulations and added red tape this year, and he still has time to impose many more before leaving office. The staggering amount of money he is costing America is likely to surge even higher. The implementation of new fuel standards for trucks resulted in the new high regulatory costs.Batkinsâ study dates back to 2005, when George W Bush held the oval office. He said that the Obama administration is responsible for about three-quarters of the added regulatory costs. âThe Obama Administration surpassed 500 major regulations last summer, imposing $625 billion in cumulative costs. Earlier this year, regulators published the administrationâs 600th major rule, increasing burdens to $743 billion. Now, thanks to data from the last term of the Bush Administration and another billion-dollar rule from EPA, the regulatory tally has surpassed $1 trillion. These figures are direct estimates from federal regulators, but it will take more than an effort from these regulators to amend hundreds of major regulations. Congress, the next president, and even the courts must participate in the next generation of regulatory modernization.âThe EPA wants to make it very difficult for the Trump administration to align fuel economy standards with the needs and expectations of Americans. EPA administrator Gina McCarthy has urged the agencyâs employees to quickly finish as many rules as possible before Obama leaves the White House. The EPA reported last month that automakers exceeded fuel efficiency standards in new cars, but were unhappy with the agencyâs early release of its fuel efficiency study.Donald Trump has promised to kill more regulations then he will add while he is in office. Hopefully his administration will kill many of the regulatory burdens created by Obama.Sources:WashingtonExaminer.comDailyCaller.com",1

215,Hillary Clinton video: THE WALKING DEAD... collapses into security van... 'medical event'... diagnosed with 'vascular dementia' and Parkinson's... 'one year left to live' says doctor,http://www.naturalnews.com/055254_Hillary_Clinton_walking_dead_medical_event.html,"(NaturalNews) Hillary Clinton's deplorable health may be far worse than we're being told. A shocking new video shows her legs collapsing out from under her while she is held up by strong-armed security men, then stumbling off the curb and collapsing face first into a waiting van.That video, shown at this Youtube link, reveals Clinton to be the ""walking dead,"" as if she's going to literally collapse and expire at any moment.The same shocking event was captured in another video from a different angle. Click here to view the second video (17 seconds). As you can see from this video, her Secret Service agents are primarily working to block any video recording of Hillary's disastrous (deplorable?) health status. They are now ""human shields"" against videography.As is now obvious to any intelligent person, Hillary's health concerns are far, far worse than anything reported in the mainstream media. It now looks like Clinton is very, very sick and possibly near death.The videos shown below are stunning in what they depict: A corrupt, criminal tyrant who deeply desires power over others now unable to control her own body... wobbling, collapsing, stumbling, with head head bobbling to the side as if her neck is on a loose swivel... then collapsing face forward into the waiting van.See the full videos here:Subcortical Vascular DementiaAccording to a self-proclaimed medical school professor in another video shown below, Hillary Clinton has a disease called Subcortical Vascular Dementia which usually gives patients just a 3-5 year life expectancy. She also just passed out at a memorial event, according to sources (see below), and had to be rushed for medical assistance.Click here to watch the first video, which includes this text description:Hillary Clinton might actually have 1 year to live based on medical records that were leaked indicating she has a disease called Subcortical Vascular Dementia. While many videos have been made about her health, all of them have missed the severity of her illness. She could die very soon, since Vascular Dementia is progressive and has a 3-5 year life expectancy. Clinton actually has a severe form of the disease that impacts the subcortex region of the brain, which includes the brainstem. This might explain why Clinton is dry-coughing so much. The brainstem controls primitive functions of the body like breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. When there is ischemia to this region, B/P, HR, and breathing won't function correctly. Hillary's cough is so noticeable because she can't seem to get over it. Most people only need a couple of coughs and they are able to overcome what is in their throat. But not Hillary. Hillary has tried to explain that she has an ""allergic cough."" This is completely false and a lie. Based on her medical records, it is related to her Vascular Dementia, which she is dying of. She could rapidly decline if circulation is weak to the brainstem.Hillary's health record also states that she has ""complex partial seizures."" I have witnessed many people who have had seizures, and I believe Hillary is definitely showing signs of seizing activity. With complex partial seizures, one can show signs such as head nodding or lip smacking. Hillary, has had several instances where she appears to have had a seizure, the most well-known is when she was in front of a group of reporters. External, noxious stimuli can trigger seizing in certain individuals. Hillary had a seizure in front of the reporters. Not unsurprisingly, they are trying to control her seizures using a Diazepam autoinjector. Autoinjectors are used with urgent drugs such as Diazepam and Epinephrine in order to stop an life-threatening event from happening. If Hillary has seizures, they could cause an oxygen deficiency in the brain, resulting in damage and further progression of her VaD. An autoinjector is needed to control the seizure.Doctor says Hillary Clinton appears to have Parkinson'sIn this video interview on Next News Network, Dr. Ted Noel explains to Gary Franchi that Hillary Clinton has a disease which disqualifies her from holding public office.From the description:Through Dr. Noel's astute observations, and relying on over 30 years in the medical field, he has concluded that Hillary Clinton is exhibiting the classic signs that point to Parkinson's Disease. He has decided to go public with his findings and appears on the Next News Network to deliver you the truth, being kept from the public, about a diagnosis that will keep her out of the Oval Office.Secret Service agent confirms Hillary Clinton's serious disease statusIn this third video, Dr. Ted Noel details even more revelations about Hillary Clinton losing consciousness during public speaking events and even a U.S. Secret Service agent confirming the seriousness of her disease.What's astonishing is how serious neurological coughing fits, public fainting and obvious public seizures are being dismissed by the complicit mainstream media as ""allergies"" or even ""conspiracy theories.""This video by Dr. Ted Noel is the best summary yet of Hillary Clinton's serious neurological disease status.Hillary's motorcade includes a private ambulance, gurney and EMT rescue workers wearing bulletproof vestsFinally, this video from Infowars reveals video proof of bulletproof vest-wearing EMT workers with a gurney and an ambulance as part of Hillary Clinton's motorcade.From the video description:Infowars reporter, Millie Weaver broke the story that Hillary Clinton has a personal medical crew that rolls a gurney up to the backstage area where she holds cough-filled rallies. The video shown is from her infamous ""Coughing Cleveland"" rally held over Memorial Day weekend.This video shows Hillary Clinton's motorcade arriving and leaving with an ambulance. Donald Trump's motorcade arrives without an ambulance. This obviously debunks the straw man argument that all presidential candidates have an ambulance in their motorcade.Hillary Clinton passes out at memorial event, has to be rushed to medical assistanceOn top of all this, ""Hillary Clinton had a 'medical episode' that required her to leave a 9/11 commemoration ceremony early on Sunday,"" reports Fox News:The Democratic presidential nominee appeared to faint on her way into her van and had to be helped by her security, the source said. She was ""clearly having some type of medical episode."" ... But a witness told Fox News that Clinton stumbled off the curb, her ""knees buckled"" and she lost a shoe as she was helped into a van during her ""unexpected early departure."" ... An unverified video of the episode appeared to show Clinton collapsing as she was helped into the van.That video is the one shown at the top of this article.Bottom line: Hillary Clinton might croak before election day... or shortly thereafterIt's not just that Hillary Clinton is a lying traitor and ""political criminal"" who has sold out America to the highest bidder -- see The Clinton Files white paper on NewsTarget.com -- it's also that Hillary Clinton is obviously and irrefutably unfit for duty.If any Republican showed all these symptoms, the entire leftist media would be demanding they step aside for health reasons. Yet Hillary's very obvious seizures and neurological fits are beyond alarming... they are clear signs that Hillary Clinton is neurologically unfit to serve as President of the United States.",1
216,Clinton Foundation caught giving watered down AIDS drugs to third world countries,http://www.naturalnews.com/055445_Clinton_Foundation_AIDS_drugs_corruption.html,"(NaturalNews) Corruption and ""pay-for-play"" scenarios involving powerful people and foreign governments that beat, imprison and kill gays is like an onion: Peel a layer and you find more.Now, as reported by The Daily Caller, it appears as though the ""charity"" was less than charitable with the AIDS drugs it helped distribute to third-world countries battling the disease.Under a program begun by former President Bill Clinton, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, officials distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs to sick patients in sub-Saharan Africa, which ""likely increased"" their risk of dying, according to a draft congressional report The Daily Caller News Foundation obtained.Titled, ""The Clinton Foundation and the India Success Story,"" the congressional report was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who is vice chairperson of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to assist AIDS victims has been considered to be a fundamental force for good within the Clinton Foundation and is very probably the organization's most notable initiative.The congressional reported centered on Clinton's 10-plus-year relationship with a controversial India-based drug maker called Ranbaxy. CHAI used the company as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS medications to poor countries.Undermining the integrity of approval processThe report also focused on the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a big-time whistleblower when he provided information to the U.S. government, which led to a landmark lawsuit against the Indian pharmaceutical company. Because the company also sold generic drugs in the United States, it was subject to U.S. regulations and prosecution for violations.Ultimately, in 2013 the company pleaded guilty to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and to introducing adulterated medications into interstate commerce. ""Adulterated"" is when a drug ""fails to conform to compendial standards of quality, strength or purity,"" according to the Food and Drug Administration.In addition, the Department of Justice levied a fine against the company of $500 million, as well as forfeiture.As noted by The Daily Caller, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, Rod J. Rosenstein, said at the time of Ranbaxy's guilty plea the case represented ""the largest false claims case ever prosecuted"" in his district, as well as the ""nation's largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company.""""When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA's approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,"" added Stuart F. Delery, the acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Justice Department, after the U.S. government made its announcement regarding Ranbaxy's case.In its final settlement, the Department of Justice stated that, ""allegedly due to the company's diluted drugs, it 'subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,'"" the congressional report noted.In an interview with The Daily Caller, Blackburn said the drugmaker's and foundation's actions produce some obvious questions, like, ""How many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise?""More problems for Hillary Clinton's campaignRevelations about CHAI potentially distributing adulterated AIDS drugs to Third World victims is likely to damage the Clinton Foundation's reputation even further, and may add another layer of corruption to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Sadly, unless her GOP opponent, Donald J. Trump, brings it up, the mainstream media won't be talking about it any time soon.As for Blackburn, she said she is planning to hand the report over to the inspector general's offices of the Department of Health and Human Services and the State Department, where Hillary Clinton served during President Obama's first term.In addition to findings of adulterated drug distribution, the report also shined a light on unseemly ties between Bill Clinton and a pair of highly controversial Indian-Americans who have fallen under investigation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.Perhaps what is most problematic for the Clinton charity is its enthusiastic promotion of Ranbaxy, even though the Indian pharmaceutical giant persistently distributes poor-quality drugs, and covers for their faulty products with fraudulent reporting to the FDA.Sources:DailyCaller.comNewsTarget.comFDA.govTheDailySheeple.com",1
217,"DNC bombshell: Murdered staffer Seth Rich sent THOUSANDS of emails to WikiLeaks, undermining entire bogus story that Russia âhackedâ election",http://www.naturalnews.com/2017-05-16-dnc-bombshell-murdered-staffer-seth-rich-sent-thousands-of-emails-to-wikileaks-undermining-entire-bogus-story-that-russia-hacked-election.html,"(Natural News) An absolute bombshell report was published Tuesday that refutes completely the discredited âmainstream mediaâ and Democratic Party lie that Russia was behind the hack of the Democratic National Committeeâs email in the months leading up to the November election.Fox Newsâ Malia Zimmerman writes that murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was in contact with whistleblower website WikiLeaks and turned over âthousandsâ of emails to the site pertaining to the corrupt inner workings of the organization:The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, investigative sources told Fox News.A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report â generated within 96 hours after DNC staffer Seth Richâs murder â detailing the contents Richâs computer said he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.The federal investigator told the news site: âI have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,â confirming that MacFadyen was genuine.These claims are in line with details unearthed by Rod Wheeler, a former Washington Metropolitan Police homicide detective and contributor to Fox News. His private detective firm was hired by the Rich family to get to the bottom of his murder.You may recall that Rich was shot very early in the morning walking home from a bar in D.C. He was very close to his home when he was gunned down. More intriguing is though D.C. police have labeled the murder a botched robbery, not a thing was stolen from Rich, though the shooter appeared to have plenty of time.Also, as Fox News noted, D.C. Metro PD isnât being cooperative; they wonât talk to the press and they wonât release video footage of the murder, which is standard procedure when cops are actually trying to find out whodunit.The federal investigator said that Rich sent MacFadyen 44,053 emails which contained 17,761 attachments from January 2015 through May 2016.Fox News noted further:On July 22, just 12 days after Rich was killed, WikiLeaks published internal DNC emails that appeared to show top party officials conspired to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont from becoming the partyâs presidential nominee. That controversy resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigning as DNC chairperson. A number of Sanders supporters refused to back party nominee Hillary Clinton, and some subsequently formed groups to work against Clinton and the party.WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has repeatedly claimed that Russia was not the source of the documents. That claim was echoed by former Trump campaign chief Roger Stone just last week.Whatâs more, as Natural News founder/editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, reported in December, citing an exclusive from the UKâs Daily Mail, the DNC wasnât hacked at all, but that documents provided to WikiLeaks were done the old-fashioned way â they were leaked â by someone upset at the way the DNC was treating Sanders:After days of witnessing the left-wing media hyperventilate over completely fabricated claims that âthe Russiansâ hacked the DNC emails and turned them over to Wikileaks, it turns out the emails were actually leaked by a DNC insider who was angry about the orchestrated elimination of Bernie Sanders by Clinton operatives.The UK Daily Mail is now reporting that Craig Murray, the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, personally met the email leaker who handed him the emails files later released by Wikileaks. The email leaker, a Bernie Sanders insider, was reportedly motivated by âdisgust at the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and the tilting of the primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders,â reports the Daily Mail.The hand-off took place in Washington D.C. in a wooded area near American University, Murray explained.âAs Julian Assange has made crystal clear, the leaks did not come from the Russians,â writes Murray on his website. âAs I have explained countless times, they are not hacks, they are insider leaks â there is a major difference between the two. And it should be said again and again, that if Hillary Clinton had not connived with the DNC to fix the primary schedule to disadvantage Bernie, if she had not received advance notice of live debate questions to use against Bernie, if she had not accepted massive donations to the Clinton foundation and family members in return for foreign policy influence, if she had not failed to distance herself from some very weird and troubling people, then none of this would have happened. The continued ability of the mainstream media to claim the leaks lost Clinton the election because of âRussiaâ, while still never acknowledging the truths the leaks reveal, is Kafkaesque.âBut still, the disgusting #NeverTrump Washington media has continued to echo the lie that the DNC was hacked, and this despite the fact that the organization refused to give the FBI permission to examine their email system in order to confirm it.As we have said early and often, this entire âRussia-Trump-collusion-hacking-steal the electionâ narrative is a massive hoax committed against the American people by the Washington establishment and Deep State.This latest report by Fox News â which, frankly, should be the No. 1 story of the day if not the entire election â proves that the Russians are being blamed for something Moscow did not do. (RELATED: Bombshell: Murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich leaked âthousands of emailsâ to WikiLeaks)This isnât to say that the Kremlin has not attempted to interfere in U.S. elections; Russiaâs been trying to do that since the days of the Cold War (and vice versa for the United States). But to blame them for something that they obviously did not do is irresponsible and conspiratorial.Democrats and Deep State operatives have been claiming that Russia was trying to undermine confidence in our electoral system. The truth is, the Democratic Party is trying to do that.People should be going to jail for this.Stay up to date on whatâs real and what isnât at Rigged.news and Hoax.news.J.D.

218,Harvey Flooding Uncovers Secret Stash Of Ammo Hidden By Obama Administration,http://ourlandofthefree.com/2017/09/harvey-flooding-uncovers-secret-stash-of-ammo-hidden-by-obama-administration/,"A cache of weapons long suspected to be hidden in Texas during Operation Jade Helm 15 was uncovered by the flood waters of Hurricane Harvey. The stockpile, hidden in a small town outside of Lexmar, matches numbers in the inventory reported missing during Obamaâs tenure.Obama and his administration flat out refused to answer where more than 200 million rounds of ammunition went while he was commander-in-chief. The traitor always maintained that there had to be a clerical error. Now that nearly 10 percent of that ammo has been found, little question remains what happened to it.The questions that do remain will have to be answered. There are 180 million rounds of ammunition out there that could be slated for use by an invasion force led by Barack Hussein Obama. He has almost a billion dollars worth of weapons and equipment. Having stockpiles of automatic rifle ammo, hand grenades and mortar shells dispersed around the country would come in awfully handy in an all-out ground assault.Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that the stockpile is being carefully inventoried to try to establish a chain of custody. Many of the lot numbers that appear on the cases have simply âvanishedâ from the GAOs accounting. When all is said and done, there will be few people between the manufacturer and the last officer to order a lot moved. Someone will be forced to pony up some answers.Hopefully, this will put an end to Obamaâs Deep State Shadow Government. If it can be established that he stole from the taxpayers for a planned coup after he left office, he can be charged with high treason.",1

224,Thanks To President Trump Radical Islamists Will No Longer Be Operating Jihad Training Sites in America,http://patriothangout.com/thanks-president-trump-radical-islamists-will-no-longer-operating-jihad-training-sites-america/,"ELDER PATRIOT â President Trump has stepped up the pressure on radical Islamists operating inside the United States and itâs started paying off. More than two years ago Ryan Mauro, a national security analyst for the Clarion Project appeared with Bill OâReilly to discuss the growing jihadist threat inside the United States. Mauro had focused his comments on five organizations that have links to Islamic extremists that have established military style training bases inside our country with the plan to unleash Jihad against America.  One such training camp is located 145 northwest of New York City in Islamberg a secluded community outside the town of Hancock, NY.  Islamberg is the home to Sufi cleric Sheikh Syed Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani and an unknown number of radical followers. Naturally, Mauro was discredited by the MSM for reporting on this. Two and a half years later we have learned that a raid on the compound conducted by NY State authorities uncovered a sizable cache of weapons in a storage locker belonging to Ramadan Abdullah that included: 8 assault weapons 4 loaded handguns 1 loaded shotgun 2 rifles 64 high-capacity ammunition feeding devices flak jackets 1,000s of rounds of ammunition, including .50-caliber armor-piercing rounds 64-year old Ramadan Abdullah, a long-time associate of a U.S.-based Islamist terrorist organization, Muslims of America (MOA), and a ranking member of the Islamberg cult was arrested and a search of his past revealed: He was previously arrested in 1977 when he tried to rob a store A man was murdered during the robbery A search of his home uncovered enough materials to build 50 bombs Before the raid on Abdullahâs storage locker in July he was arrested trying to steal four boxes of ammunition from a local store. All of this led police to begin searches of other locations that Abdullah often visited.  These searches turned up loaded handguns, more high-capacity ammunition feeding devices and ammunition. While New York State Police Major Jim Barnes said, âThereâs no indication there was a plan in place to commit an act of violence,â he did confirm that police believe Abdullah had made trips overseas. During that 2015 interview Mauro had shown OâReilly a video given to him by a law enforcement source that shows members marching with rifles in apparent guerilla warfare training. Mauro also identified: The Dar-al Hijrah mosque in the Seven Corners section of Falls Church, Va., that was once led by Anwar al-Awlaki, the al Qaeda al-Awlaki. The mosque, near Washington, D.C., is now led by an imam who said, âMuslims shall be first in line for the arms for jihad.â The Masjid At Taqwa mosque in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn The Islamic Circle of North America, a radical group that is legitimized by only 2 percent of American Muslims that has its headquarters a few miles from Masjid At Taqwa in Queens, New York. CAIR, or the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The US Department of Justice has classified CAIR as a âpolitical influence organization of the Muslim brotherhoodâ. Yet nothing was done to check this radical Islamic threat until earlier this month.  Somehow Iâm led to conclude that as long as Obama was president nothing would ever be done to protect us from Islamic extremism. Or, maybe it was just Jim Comeyâs worthless direction of the F.B.I. that let these groups operate with impunity. Thank God for Donald Trump.",1
225,FRAUD: Democrat Worker Sentenced to Prison for Registering Dead Voters,http://patriothangout.com/fraud-democrat-worker-sentenced-prison-registering-dead-voters/,"HANNITY| A liberal student at James Madison University was sentenced to upwards of four months in prison for registering dead people to vote in the state of Virginia, reports the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Andrew Spieles, a 21-year old man from Harrisonburg, Virginia, was found guilty after admitting he filed phony registration applications at least 18 times, often involving dead people. The student worked for Harrisonburg Votes, an organization with close ties to the stateâs democratic party. âIn August 2016, Spieles was directed to combine his registration numbers with those of another individual because their respective territories overlapped,â said a statement from the U.S. Attorneyâs Office. âEvery Thursday an employee/volunteer hand-delivered the paper copies of the registration forms to the Registrarâs Office in Harrisonburg.â The scheme was discovered after election officials noticed that new voter applications were turning up in the names of recently deceased people, including the father of a prominent local judge. âThe Registrarâs Office discovered multiple instances of similarly falsified forms when it reviewed additional registrations. Some were in the names of deceased individuals while others bore incorrect middle names, birth dates, and social security numbers,â the statement added. Spieles told the court he submitted the fraudulent material in order to reach a pre-determined âquotaâ imposed on him by Harrisonburg Votes.",1
226,DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR & CLINTON INSIDER BUSTED Trying To COVER UP MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD â¦ TRUMP WAS RIGHT,http://patriothangout.com/ider-bkkked-0/,"Democrats love voters.All voters. White ones, brown ones, boy ones, girl ones â¦ even illegal ones.And if youâre illegal and brown, why, they might even throw a parade for you.They claim that âvoter fraudâ is non-existent, but maybe thatâs because leftists do such a good job hiding it.Like in Virginia, when state officials tried to hide decades of voter fraud in their state â where foreign nationals, illegal immigrants, and others were casting ballots in elections for decades.A new report released by the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) showed there were more than 5,000 ânoncitizensâ who were registered to vote and were bumped from the voter rolls.Hereâs the kicker: Those 5,000 were only pulled from the rolls because they self-reported that they shouldnât be voting, The Washington Times reports.Starting with Gov. Terry McAuliffe, officials desperately tried to hide the fraud.âAt the instruction of Governor McAuliffeâs political appointees, local election officials spent countless resources to prevent this information from spilling into the open,â PILF President J. Christian Adams said in a statement releasing the report. âFrom NoVa to Norfolk and all urban and rural points in between, alien voters are casting ballots with practically no legal consequences in response.âThis is just one issue that is likely to come up as President Trumpâs voter integrity commission investigates the elections process and finding out how people who shouldnât vote do and people who want to vote canât.President Donald Trump singled Virginia out as a locus of massive voter fraud after last yearâs election. In late November, explaining his shortfall in the national popular vote, Mr. Trump said there was âseriousâ fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California.He didnât give specific evidence, but attributed a lack of attention to the issue to âserious biasâ in the press.âBig problem!â Mr. Trump said on Twitter.Edgardo Cortes, Virginiaâs elections commissioner, said at the time said there were no indications of fraud, saying that the ballots cast were counted properly.But Mr. Trumpâs contention is not that valid votes werenât cast. He says, rather, that millions of ineligible voters are being allowed to vote.",1

229,FBI: Rumors About Clinton Pedophile Ring Are True,https://www.dailyinfobox.com/2017/04/16/fbi-rumors-clinton-pedophile-ring-true/,"Multiple sources within the FBI and NYPD have confirmed Hillary Clintonâs involvement in a massive pedophile ring in Washington DC.According to experts on Reddit, insiders have recently confirmed&nbsp;rumors that a child sex scandal involving the Clintonâs and their cronies are& true and about to become public knowledge.Reddit.com reports:It seems that things are about to heat up. We are told that of the 662,871 emails lifted from Anthony Weinerâs computer, 11,112 emails are Huma Abedinâsâ¦ and pay to play â including Saudis and Israelis. Meaning Huma was the one Hillary used to communicate with foreign leaders via email for inside information and deals via Humaâs computer.It has been established through many avenues, but mainly through Wikileaks, that the Clinton Foundation was just a farce set up in order to perform pay-to-play games with multiple entities, including foreign nations. Pay-to-play nations include: Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Kazakhstan, and the Ukraine.Furthermore, we are told by one of our insiders that one email unequivocally confirms ISIS was created by CIA and Israeli Secret Intelligence Service, with help from Joe Lieberman, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham!An NYPD insider said the content they viewed did include State Department Top Secret emails. One file was called âLife Insuranceâ. A second file was titled âDNC Nuclear Arsenalâ.A third file Iâm sure Hillary definitely does not want released was a file labeled âIntimateââ¦ according to this NYPD insider, this file contained X-rated photos of Huma and Hillary with a teenager.NYPD detectives were sickened by what they saw, according to our insider, and they had threatened FBI field agents that they would leak this information, if the FBI did not âstep up and take off the kid glovesâ. At that point, 13 of the FBI agents in NYC were also threatening to leak the information.As you can imagine, the scandal has the entire Obama Administration in full panic. We are told there are emails that could send Loretta Lynch to prison, as well as Bill and Hillary.The following information comes straight from an FBI Anonymous source, who is the senior analyst who posted on 4chan in early July of this year:Jim Comey learned that some of his own investigators were tipping off both Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton, thus making his job impossible.Comey sent a letter to Congress, knowing that ultimately it would expose Loretta Lynch as a dirty actor and the breadcrumbs would lead directly to Obama. The State Department is terrified now. Comey has assembled a small team of 40 agents, whom he has declared âThe Untouchablesâ after the famous federal agent Eliot Ness.Comey has clamped down on all FBI agents and he expects a full-scale war between the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the White House, and the State Department. He has confirmed and understands that many sitting senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and power players are going to be indicted and prosecuted. One of the main targets of the probe is the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Among the targets under investigation are John Podesta, Huma, Cheryl Mills, CNN, ABC, NBC, etc.As it turns out, Weiner, Humaâs husband, had been forwarding Humaâs emails each time she came home and left her computer open. Huma appears to have been in touch with Saudi actors, and therefore, espionage is strongly suspected.Comey and his 40 âUntouchablesâ are now preparing to take down the largest corruption ever witnessed in American historyâ¦ which is what I think must happen if Comey is planning to stay part of the FBI. He lost so much respect and so much credibility with the first Hillary investigation, it would take something of this magnitude to allow him to face the public again.The Pentagon has internal players and outside players they call âcreativesâ. Creatives are civilians who tend to be geniuses, malcontents, extreme hackers, or otherwise demonstrate brilliance in other useful areas. A Pentagon program called Cicada 3301 which we have reported on previously, was created by several of these talented civilians. The program is now used to allow thousands of honest government people to report on their corrupt superiors, using what is called a dead box whistleblower encryption method so the non-corrupted government officials can report corruption and still remain safe.",1

Of course, he caved.âIt has been brought to our attention that the young Miss Obama has not been found guilty of a crime and therefore we acted hastily in suspending her,â Finklestein said in a statement late Sunday night. âWe sincerely apologize to the Obama family and specifically to Malia for any harm we caused.âThe lifting of Obamaâs suspension means she can move into the dorms with other students, perhaps with drugs she obtained elsewhere.There is no justice when the Obamas are involved.",1

I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against youâ â Trump warned.Trump went on to invite all Jehovahâs Witnesses in Russia to seek asylum in the United States until their religious rights are reinstated in Russia.âAs this is an infringement of your fundamental human rights, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated.â â Trump urged.Russiaâs Supreme Court ruled on April 20, 2017 that the Jehovahâs Witnesses organization should be closed down and no longer allowed to operate legally in Russia, Human Rights Watch said today. The ruling, which affects more than 100,000 Jehovahâs Witness worshippers across Russia, is a serious breach of Russiaâs obligations to respect and protect religious freedom.The case could be taken to the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled a previous attempted ban on Jehovahâs Witnesses in Russia unlawful in 2010.The Supreme Court was deciding on a claim lodged by the Russian ministry of justice to liquidate the groupâs administrative centre near St Petersburg and 395 local organisations. Its decision will come into effect within 30 days unless an appeal is lodged, when it will be delayed until the resolution of the case.âThe Supreme Court has ruled to sustain the claim of Russiaâs ministry of justice and deem the âAdministrative Centre of Jehovahâs Witnesses in Russiaâ organisation extremist, eliminate it and ban its activity in Russia,â said judge Yuri Ivanenko. âThe property of the Jehovahâs Witnesses organisation is to be confiscated to the state revenue.âA lawyer for the justice ministry, Svetlana Borisova, told the court adherents âpose a threat to the rights of the citizens, public order and public securityâ.Jehovahâs Witnesses, who are known for door-to-door preaching and handing out literature, reject some of mainstream Christianityâs core beliefs and have more than 8.3 million members around the world.",1

The Obama Administration originally said he was taking the properties in order to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, but that was just a clever ruse to fool the sheeple.

The ranch, just a few hundred miles north of anything in Wyoming, was also seized along with a fleet of automobiles, recreational vehicles and other property now considered the spoils of the drug trade.The bust itself yielded more than $6 million in finished drugs alone, never mind the plants and raw product waiting for packaging. All in all, Senator Lindsay is looking at 70 years behind bars on the opium alone. He was taken into custody at his office in Washington DC and has since been booked and released on $10 million bail.Lindsayâs office isnât commenting on the ordeal but New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has already called for his removal and a special election as soon as possible.

How she got into the Clintonsâ guest home and why she ended up dead are still unknown.Hagliarty, a waitress at a local restaurant, was reported missing over a week ago. According to her mother, she had no reason to be in that house:âShe didnât know them Clintons. Sheâs a Trump girl. She wouldnât be hanging around there no way no how.

It seems somewhat obvious that this poor young woman wasnât there willingly and that her life ended horribly and tragically at the hands of a madman.Could Bill Clinton have pulled this off or is he too old? Thatâs what investigators are now looking into. Clinton still has Secret Service protection but not much and not in the interior of their property.

Stay over 180 days would therefore require a visa.Trump says this measure is to strengthen trade between the United States and Pakistan.However, Pakistanis who hold dual nationality will be banned from entering the United States if their other passport is from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen  the seven Muslim-majority countries of concern.It has emerged that trade and bilateral visa deals have been discussed by Trump and Pakistani Diplomats in the States.A source at the White House has hinted that Trump may revoke Australias opportunity of traveling to the United States without visas after cancelling all trade deals with the country.Allowing Pakistanis to the United States freely is not the only order signed into force by Trump since assuming office.

243,A LOCAL NAACP BRANCH SAYS BLACK COPS ARE NOT REAL BLACK PEOPLE,https://downtrend.com/71superb/naacp-says-black-cops-are-not-real-black-people,"One of the craziest things to come out of the Keith Scott shooting in Charleston, NC is the idea that it is racist for a black police officer to use deadly force on an armed black man. A local branch of the NAACP, in its infinite wisdom, has come up with a foolproof way around this little problem. According to the organization, black cops are not real black people so therefore it is racist when they shoot actual black people.The local NAACP is not convinced the Scott shooting was justified, despite multiple videos showing that he was armed. Even the facts that a gun was recovered from the scene and that Scott was illegally carrying a weapon when police shot him has done nothing to persuade them.On Tuesday the NAACP made a list of demands to the Charlotte police department to ensure black police officers never again shoot and kill threatening armed black men. As reported by WCNC, the organization that supposedly represents black people dropped this bomb:Many black people who become police officers become blue, not black. In order for you to survive in a police department, you take on the police departments ideology, ways of life, and culture, said an NAACP representative.It doesnt get any clearer than that. The NAACP is saying that becoming a police officer robs a black man of his black essence. That black cops are no longer truly black and must surrender their black card to the NAACP. In the context of the Keith Scott shooting, this statement also implies that black police officers are transformed into racist white killers of innocent black men.This goes along with the popular black concept that articulate black people are acting white, or that responsible employed black people have sold out to the man. The NAACP is reinforcing the bullshit belief that the only way to be black is to be a jive-talking white-hating revolutionary scumbag.Charlotte Officer Brentley Vinson (pictured) has been identified as the one who shot and killed Keith Scott. He is black and by all accounts a good cop. He is the son of one of the first black detectives to ever serve the Charlotte police department. He is a former star athlete who played football at Liberty University and Fork Union Military Academy. There is no record of him engaging in police misconduct and I guarantee this is the first time anyone has ever questioned his blackness.With their statement, the NAACP is saying that Brentley Vinson is an Uncle Tom who did the white mans bidding by murdering a black man. Youd be hard-pressed to find a more offensive thing said about this 100% justified police shooting.Keith Scott was armed with a handgun and refused numerous police commands to drop the weapon. He posed an imminent danger to Vinson and his fellow officers. Scott forced Vinson into using deadly force. Any other person on the planet would have done the same thing if confronted with this dangerous situation. It wasnt racism or Uncle Tomism that made Vinson pull the trigger, it was self-defense, defense of his fellow officers, and defense of the community at large that did. He did his job.Update 9/30/16 11:49 EST. This article has been edited to reflect the fact that the statements made herein were from a local branch of the NAACP  not the national branch.",1
244,LIBERALS AT WORK: CALIFORNIA JUST LEGALIZED CHILD PROSTITUTION,https://downtrend.com/71superb/liberals-at-work-california-just-legalized-child-prostitution,"This is absolutely astounding. The liberal numbnuts who run the State of California just decriminalized child prostitution. There is no misinterpretation of what theyve done here. It is no longer illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to engage in prostitution or to solicit money for sex. Like I said, kids in California are now able to legally work as prostitutes.CBS Sacramento reports that space cadet Governor Jerry Brown signed SB1322 into law on Tuesday. Among other things, this bill exempts minors from the current California prostitution laws. In other words, a person under the age of 18 can no longer be arrested for violating prostitution laws that apply to adults.I was thinking that maybe the news was reporting this wrong or perhaps they were leaving some stuff out that makes this sound less terrible than it is, but I read the actual wording of the bill and this is what is says:Existing law makes it a crime to solicit or engage in any act of prostitution. Existing law makes it a crime to loiter in any public place with the intent to commit prostitution. This bill would make the above provisions inapplicable to a child under 18 years of age who is alleged to have engaged in conduct that would, if committed by an adult, violate the above provisions.If a child or teen cant be arrested for prostitution, then that means underage prostitution is now legal in the state. I dont see any other way to look at this insanity. Presumably it is still illegal for an adult to patronize a child prostitute, but from the kids perspective it is all good. Also presumably, a person under the age of 18 could pay to have sex with another person under the age of 18 and that would be completely legal in the Golden State.The law doesnt put any kind of an age limit for minors so a 6-year-old can now legally work the streets.From what I understand the purpose of this law is to remove the stigma of prostitution related convictions for minors who were forced into the sex trade. It may actually achieve that, but it certainly doesnt deter kids from getting into the game. Decriminalizing prostitution for minors sends a very bad message that some kids are going to pick up on.Interestingly enough, Gov. Brown vetoed another bill that would provide aide to victims of sex trade human trafficking. Basically he just said F*ck you kids, if you want money get out on the street and earn it yourselves.Is this what they mean when they talk about progressive leadership? I guess technically this law creates jobs and will probably generate more tourism for the state. Still, I feel like there is a less morally reprehensible way to do this.So just when you thought California couldnt be any more of an insane asylum, they go ahead and legalize child prostitution. I have no more words for this.",1

They stopped frequently to offer encouraging words to the medical staff and to spend time with patients.The boy, who was not named for privacy and HIPPA concerns, is said to be fine and well today, and is said to be voting for Donald in Orlando where heâs from.Arnold Palmer founded both the Arnold Palmer Pavilion at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, Florida.

Melania Trump speaks a shocking 5 languages. Thatâs 4 more than Michelle Obama, and 2 more than Jacky Kennedy, who used her knowledge of French and Italian to help JFK negotiate with leaders across the Globe. Melania knows Serbian, Slovenian, German, French, and English. She knows a bit of a lot of different languages. She grew up in communist Yugoslavia and speaks five languages. Slovene, English, French, Serbian and German, if you want to know. That linguistic prowess could come in handy at White House functions, but it has been suggested her thick accent is the reason she makes few public speeches alongside her immigrant-bashing husband. Melania was raised away from the glamour of New York high society in a concrete tower block in then Yugoslavia during the rule of Marshal Josip Tito. Now that her husband has become president, Melania is the first first lady to be born in a communist nation and only the second to be born abroad, after Louisa Adams, the English wife of sixth president John Quincy, who served from 1825 to 1829. Melaniaâs home country appears to believe her rise to the White House could be an opportunity to increase its own standing in the world. Tiny Slovenia, with its population of two million, has positioned itself as a possible mediator between the US and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who rarely makes trips to western states, has visited Slovenia twice and the two nations have a comfortable relationship with one another. Prime Minister Miro Cerar told the Associated Press last year: âIf the United States and Russia give some initiative in this way, Slovenia could become a bridge between the two powers. Donaldâs apparent soft spot for Russia may mean Sloveniaâs services are not required. However, Cerar said he had spoken to Melania in a phone call following the Trump election victory, both chatting in their native tongue. Intel scholars have proven her IQ is the highest based on her self made fortune and her knowledge of many languages. Sheâs also the best looking first lady in history.",1

Ryan White was infected with HIV when he was only 13 years old. He had hemophilia, a blood-clotting disease that meant he needed to get blood transfusions all through his childhood. In the 1980s, HIV was a new disease and no one yet knew to screen donated blood. Ryan White was one of the first people in the US to talk openly about having HIV and became famous in the US and all over the world. He bravely fought to educate others about HIV and against the stigma and discrimination HIV-positive people often face. In 1984, Ryanâs high school in Kokomo, Indiana, learned about his status. They refused to let him return to the school for fear that he would infect other students. Ryan was only allowed to participate in classroom activities by telephone. His family fought the superintendentâs decision in court and Ryan was able to return to school after a judge ruled in his favor. He was tormented when he returned to school. Students frequently insulted him and wrote degrading statements on his locker. His family faced discrimination as well. Store clerks refused to hand his mother change because they didnât want to touch her. Restaurants threw away plates and silverware after the White family ate there. Someone even fired a gun into a window of the familyâs home. In 1987 the Whites moved to Cicero, Indiana, so Ryan could attend a school that would not discriminate against him. Instead, the school board held conferences for parents and students to educate the community about HIV/AIDS and to encourage compassion rather than fear and discrimination. A student at Ryanâs new high school later said, âWhen he first came a lot of people were really scared, but Ryan helped all of us to understand.â In 1988, Ryan spoke at the Presidentâs Commission on AIDS. âBecause of the lack of education on AIDS, discrimination, fear, panic, and lies surrounded me. I was labeled a troublemaker, my mom an unfit mother, and I was not welcome anywhere. People would get up and leave so they would not have to sit anywhere near me. Even at church, people would not shake my hand. This brought on the news media, TV crews, interviews, and numerous public appearances. I became known as the AIDS boy. I received thousands of letters of support from all around the world, all because I wanted to go to school.â Ryan became very ill during his senior year of high school. Celebrities and public figures, including Vice President Dan Quayle, President George H.W. Bush, Donald Trump, Michael Jackson, and Elton John, called while Ryan was in the hospital to wish him well. At this time, though, doctors knew very little about how to treat HIV. Ryan died on April 8, 1990, surrounded by his mother, grandparents, and Elton John. Even in death Ryan could not escape the hatred and discrimination; his gravesite was vandalized four times in the following two years. Ryanâs story was told in many newspapers, magazines, and television shows, and a TV movie was made about his life. His courage and openness started the conversation about HIV and the prejudice HIV-positive people face. At a time when HIV was called a gay disease or a drug addictâs disease, Ryan would say, âIâm just like everyone else with AIDS, no matter how I got it.â Trump and Michael Jackson visited the boy frequently and Donald paid for his health treatments via his exclusive jets.",1

When Donald Trump was sworn in a US President, he signed an executive order, that reversed a previous order signed by Barack Obama just days before he left office that removed Dana Boente from his position behind the Attorney General as second in line.Dana Boente was bumped down the power scale without explanation from Obama, but with his renewed authority, he now says he will bring charges against any liberals or Democrats that are working to undermine the president. Itâs widely believed that Obama, along with Hillary Clinton, is working with the Deep State in a bid to overthrow Trumpâs presidency by inciting riots across America which Boente considers to be an act of domestic terrorism.According to a recent report by the New York Post, the former president has vowed to fight his Republican successor at every turn of his historic presidency and Obama will command an army of agitators from a bunker less than two miles from the Whiet House.CDTZT REPORTS : WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA IMMEDIATELY UPON LEAVING OFFICE ESTABLISHING A PRIVATE WEBSITE AND PROCLAIMING ON IT THAT âI WONâT STOP; IN FACT, I WILL BE RIGHT THERE WITH YOU, AS A CITIZEN, FOR ALL MY DAYS THAT REMAIN.â ITâS OBVIOUS TO EVEN LAYMEN TO DEDUCE THAT âTHE BERKELEY RIOTS MAY HAVE BEEN ORDERED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA HIMSELF.â THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE FOR THE FBI TO IMPLICATE OBAMA FOR SEDITION AND TREASON BUT BEHIND THE SCENES, THERE IS FIERCE DEBATE OVER THE FALLOUT INCLUDING WORRYING ABOUT TRAITORS AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT IF ACTION WAS TAKEN AGAINST THE AGITATOR IN CHIEF.Many concerns have been raised due to his gathering around him an ""army of agitators"" (numbering more than 30,000) who he commands from a bunker less than two blocks from the White House.Barack Obama, who many claim will be creating a shadow government to frustrate the policy goals of this administration, weâre looking at something thatâs coming very close to, it seems to me, sedition,â Lou Dobbs revealed",1
249,MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SWUNG ELECTIONS TO DEMOCRATS IN 2016 ELECTIONS,https://70news.wordpress.com/2017/09/07/massive-voter-fraud-in-new-hampshire-swung-elections-to-democrats-in-2016-elections/,"On election day, there were 6,540 same-day registrants who registered to vote in New Hampshire using an out-of-state driverâs license to prove their identity.Nearly ten months after the election â only 1,014 of the 6,540 same-day registrants who registered with an out-of-state license had obtained a New Hampshire driverâs licenseSo 5,313 of those voters neither obtained a New Hampshire driverâs license nor registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. They have not followed the legal requirements for residents regarding driverâs licenses, and it appears that they are not actually residing in New Hampshire.From Breitbart:Facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshireâs U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshireâs four electoral college votes in the presidential election.New Hampshire is one of fifteen states that allow same-day voter registration. The benefit of same-day registration is that it allows a person who has procrastinated or has forgotten to register to nonetheless cast a ballot on election day. The downside of same-day registration is that it does not allow the state time to assess the eligibility of the voter. A volunteer poll worker simply accepts a modicum of identification and takes the voter at his word that heâs a U.S. citizen resident of the state who is eligible to vote.According to statistics released by the Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, on the date of the general election in November 2016, there were 6,540 same-day registrants who registered to vote in New Hampshire using an out-of-state driverâs license to prove their identity.So if those 6,540 voters were bona fide New Hampshire residents, they would get their driverâs license no later than January 7, 2017. However, the numbers tell a very different story. It turns out that, as of August 30, 2017 â nearly ten months after the election â only 1,014 of the 6,540 same-day registrants who registered with an out-of-state license had obtained a New Hampshire driverâs license. The other 5,526 individuals never obtained a New Hampshire driverâs license. And, of those 5,526, only 213 registered a vehicle in New Hampshire.So 5,313 of those voters neither obtained a New Hampshire driverâs license nor registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. They have not followed the legal requirements for residents regarding driverâs licenses, and it appears that they are not actually residing in New Hampshire. It seems that they never were bona fide residents of the State.5,513 is a big number â more than enough to swing two very important elections. The closest major election was the contest between incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte and challenger Maggie Hassan (D). Hassan won the election by a razor-thin margin of 1,017 votes. Those 5,313 fraudulent votes were more than enough to swing the election. If 59.2 percent or more of them went for Hassan, then the election was stolen through voter fraud. Thatâs likely, since the surrounding states are Democrat strongholds.Itâs also possible that New Hampshireâs four electoral college votes were swung to Hillary Clinton through illegal voting by nonresidents. Clinton won New Hampshire by only 2,732 votes. If 74.8 percent of the 5,513 fraudulent votes were cast for Clinton, then the presidential election in New Hampshire was tipped as well.Read more: Exclusive â Kobach: Out-of-State Voters Apparently Changed Outcome of New Hampshire U.S. Senate RaceThis entry was posted in POLITICS and tagged election, New Hampshire, vote fraud.",1
250,Pope endorses Donald Trump,http://nesaranews.blogspot.com/2016/07/pope-endorses-donald-trump.html,"VATICAN CITY â News outlets around the world are reporting on the news that Pope Francis has made the unprecedented decision to endorse a US presidential candidate. His statement in support of Donald Trump was released from the Vatican this evening:âI have been hesitant to offer any kind of support for either candidate in the US presidential election but I now feel that to not voice my concern would be a dereliction of my duty as the Holy See. A strong and free America is vitally important in maintaining a strong and free world and in that sense what happens in American elections affects us all. The Rule of Law is the backbone of the American government as it is in any nation that strives for freedom and I now fear that the Rule of Law in America has been dealt a dangerous blow. The FBI, in refusing to recommend prosecution after admitting that the law had been broken on multiple occasions by Secretary Clinton, has exposed itself as corrupted by political forces that have become far too powerful. Though I donât agree with Mr. Trump on some issues, I feel that voting against the powerful political forces that have corrupted the entire American federal government is the only option for a nation that desires a government that is truly for the people and by the people.  For this primary reason I ask, not as the Holy Father, but as a concerned citizen of the world that Americans vote for Donald Trump for President of the United States.âSources within the Vatican reportedly were aware that the Pope had been discussing the possibility of voicing his concern in the US presidential election but apparently were completely unaware that he had made a decision on going forward with voicing this concern until his statement was released this evening from the Vatican.

NFL ticket sales were down 18% after the protests.DIRECTV was reportedly forced to give offended fans refunds on a premium football package. One Indianapolis Colts fan and military veteran even burned his season tickets.And NFL executives have started taking notice of fansâ outrage.Denver Broncos General Manager and legendary quarterback John Elway said the football field isnât the place to play politics. The Broncos, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Green Bay Packers have all announced that they will be standing for the anthem going forward.And other teams are certain to follow.âI promise you one thing, this week we will all be standing out there for the national anthem. Trust me,â said Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey.This comes just one week after the Steelers refused to take the field at all for the national anthem.Of course, some NFL players may continue their protests. But what seemed like a league-wide coalition just days ago has fallen apart over fan unrest, financial pressures, and criticism from Trump.This latest win is vintage Trump. He used social media and speeches to communicate directly with his base of millions of Americans, bypassing the mainstream media that largely supported the protests.The NFL learned the hard way that Trump, as president, still has the most influential bully pulpit in the world.And heâs not afraid to use it when pampered athletes are disrespecting our country or our flag.",1

Under the Obama administration IRS political appointees illegally targeted conservative groups, either making them wait up to seven years for tax-exempt status or denying their application altogether.Judicial Watch uncovered that scandal and has obtained piles of government records showing how the IRS illegally colluded with another federal agency to single out groups with conservative-sounding terms such as patriot and Tea Party in their titles when applying for tax-exempt status.In the meantime, leftist groups like the Satan club got fast tracked. The principle goal of establishing the Satan clubs in public schools throughout Washington State appears to be to counter existing enterprises operated by a Christian-based group.Documents obtained by Judicial Watch include the process of establishing an after-school Satan club at Point Defiance Elementary in Tacoma. The entity behind the club is a nonprofit called Reason Alliance, which is based in Somerville, Massachusetts, and operates in Washington State as the Satanic Temple of Seattle. Its director, Lilith X. Starr, established the Point Defiance Elementary Satanic club, the records show. In its application the club states that its purpose is âcharacter developmentâ and that adult instructors are vetted by the Satanic Templeâs âExecutive Ministry.â Children ages 5-12 will develop basic critical reasoning, character qualities, problem solving and creative expression, according to the Satanic Temple filings included in the documents.

Dr. Noel, who believes Hillary has Parkinsonâs disease, suggested that gaps in Hillary Clintonâs public schedule could be due to making sure her medications for Parkinsonâs remain effective.âA âdrug holidayâ is often prescribed for Parkinsonâs disease patients,â Noel said. âThe problem is that Parkinsonâs patients need increased doses of their medication as the disease progresses.âThe drug holiday would âallow her physicians to get her drug-free for a while, so she can be on lower doses when the drugs are restarted.ââShe needs to be able to come on stage appearing to walk and smile normally,âThe doctor has made videos in which he has claimed that Clinton has displayed Parkinsonâs symptoms.âIn Parkinsonâs disease, the drug dosing is a problem,â Noel explained in one of his videos.âHillary, if she is going to be out in public for a debate, needs her drugs to last for something like two-and-a-half hours,â he added.âIf you stop taking your drugs for a period of time, and then restart them, the drugs will last quite a bit longer.

257,Donald Trump Says The Earth Is Flat,http://cnn.com.de/news/donald-trump-says-earth-flat/,"Baltimore, MD (AP) â Speaking to reporters in Baltimore on Monday, following the 138th conference for the National Guard Association of the United States, the Republican Partyâs presidential nominee revealed that he is a member of a growing population known generally as flat earth truthers.âI fly a lot, and I mean a lot. No one flies more than me. Listen, I own a jet. I own a 757, beautiful plane, itâs the best plane! If the world were round, believe me, I would know!âThe comments came in response to a question from AP reporter, Charles Darr, regarding the future role of the National Guard, as private companies proliferate space travel. âMr. Trump, if elected, are you willing to increase taxes in order to meet the growing budget demands of the National Guard, as existential threats from our enemies grow along with the advancement of space travel technology?â Darr asked.The President-elect replied that such a future is ânonsense,â adding that âthe round earth people, and you know who they are, these people have an agenda.ââItâs all on the Internet, itâs there.âAfter declaring that the world is flat, Mr. Trump, as he has done before, again cited âthe Internetâ as his primary source of information. âThere are people out there, many people, and I mean missile experts, sailors, you name it, folks, and this is what theyâre saying. Itâs all on the Internet, itâs there.âThe flat earth conspiracy theory, like most conspiracy theories, is propagated primarily via the Internet. Internet forums and YouTube channels are dedicated to âenlighteningâ the vast majority who, as truthers explain, naively buy into the âglobe earth theoryâ that has been sold to them since birth.One piece of evidence that flat earth truthers present as proof that there is a global conspiracy against them, is the emblem used by the United Nations, implying that the intergovernmental organization is part of the conspiracy. In it, the planet is displayed as a flat earth, with the northern pole at the center, and southern hemisphere continents stretched out toward the circumference, just as the planet really is, according to truthers.Flat earth model designed by evangelical minister, WIlbur Glenn Voliva, 1931In April, after stating that he is open to allowing Japan and South Korea to develop nuclear weapons to alleviate the financial costs of the United Statesâ role as âpolicemen to the world,â Trump also suggested minimizing the authority of the United Nations. âBy the way, United Nations,â Trump said, âsame thing, smaller numbers.âIn now deleted tweets, Trump also seemingly offered Biblical evidence of a flat earth.âBook of Matthew, folks, the devil took him to a very high mountain, very high, and what did he do?

258,Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide,http://cnn.com.de/news/obama-signs-executive-order-banning-pledge-allegiance-schools-nationwide/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) â Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal governmentâs official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. Under the new order, it is now illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty. This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.During the press conference, the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is âdivisiveâ and âcontrary to Americaâs deepest held values.ââThe pledge excludes so many Americans who are vital to making this country what it is,â Obama said. âAsking someone to pledge their allegiance to our country excludes Jehovahâs Witnesses, Amish, Muslims, and many others whose religious beliefs prohibit strong displays of nationalism. By calling this âone nation under Godâ, we exclude the millions of hard working atheists and agnostics who call America home. By saying âliberty and justice for allâ, we ignore the grievances of millions of Hispanics, African Americans and Muslims who feel they have neither liberty nor justice.âObama told reporters that he believes the inclusion of âunder Godâ runs afoul of the First Amendmentâs establishment clause. He summed up his press briefing by challenging congress to create a new pledge that more accurately reflects Americaâs values.âI am willing to rescind my decision here today and allow the Pledge of Allegiance back into the schools if we can all agree on the creation of a new Pledge, something that is includes everyoneâs beliefs and not just the belief of one nationality or faith.âDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of president Obamaâs decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in Novemberâs general election. She echoed his concerns about the pledgeâs language and suggested that the pledgeâs mention of God sends the wrong message to Americaâs children.âI fully support the President and the decision that he has made here today. In January, when I take office as the next President of the United States, unless I see otherwise, I will do my best to uphold this new law and ensure that it stays in effect.âRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not mince words when voicing his contempt for the presidentâs order, referring to the president as an âillegitimate Muslim traitor.ââAs a Christian nation, the Pledge of Allegiance helps our children be the greatest children out there, the best there is, greater than all the other children in this world combined. Obama, who founded ISIS by the way, wants them not to be great, he wants them to be weak, and by banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools, he has proven that here today. This is the first step in many in his master plan to force Sharia law onto this great country of ours before he leaves office in January. We all must remember that this is one nation under God and not some guy and his beliefs in whatever he chooses to believe.âSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about the ban.âThis is a story about President Obama banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools.â Bradley said. âI just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps.âLawrence Ketchum of the Secular Coalition for America told reporters that Obamaâs decision to ban the Pledge is a victory for all those who oppose government control.âWhen our children are forced to chant, âOne nation under Godâ, whose God are they referring to exactly?â Ketchum said, âFrom birth, children are indoctrinated and subjected to mind control, efforts to shape them into the perfect beings that society wants them to be. The Pledge of Allegiance is just one of the many tools used in a childâs involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values.â Ketchum continued, âThis is a great day not just for Atheists, but for all Americans who value freedom. Forcing children to pledge blind allegiance to this country and profess a belief in a God is extremely dangerous in developing young minds and amounts to little more than government mind control.âWhile Executive Order 13738 is likely to be a source of heated debate among Americans, constitutional scholar, Paul Horner, told ABC News that it is unlikely the law will be challenged in court.âSince this law only affects federal employees and contractors and not the general populace, it is well within the traditional scope of a presidentâs executive authority to pass this law. Any challenges would lack proper legal standing and more than like be quickly dismissed.âFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told ABC News he believes in what Utah is doing.âIt is important that children become the unique individuals that this country wants them to be. Conforming into the perfect little human beings that God intended them to be has always been the American way. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then weâll burn in Hell for eternity.âDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate aricles they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.âYou have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the sex reassignment surgery my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a little boy,â Mikkleson said. âWe claim âto provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as wellâ, but thatâs just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thatâs it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and Iâm only telling you this for legal reasons.â Mikkleson continues, âA typical story of ours makes wild claims, using grammatical errors, misspellings and words like âumimumimaginativeâ, ârecycledâ, âhoaxâ, saying that a story âillegally appropriates the trademarks of legitimate news organizationsâ, but we list no links or sources of information, they are all just wild claims by us. And that story will get 50,000 shares or more on Facebook, thatâs a lot of ad revenue for only writing a couple sentences.â Mikkelson further explains, âIt is common for us to rewrite a story weâre debunking if we donât like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a personâs name from the original article and then called him a liar, itâs so funny! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,â Mikkelson laughs. âAnd lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Our writers like Zarronandia go as far as to say that the story originated from âa clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false ânewsâ storiesâ. But we donât list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; Itâs just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and as I said before, I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work?âOriginally composed by Colonel George Balch in 1887, The Pledge of Allegiance was later revised by Francis Bellamy in 1892 and formally adopted by Congress in 1942. The Pledge is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America. The official name of the Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945 and the last changes made to it came on Flag Day in 1954 when the words âunder Godâ were added.The Obama Administration has set up a 24-hour hotline to address any questions and concerns the public may have regarding the new order. The number for the hotline is (785) 273-0325.",1
259,The Amish In America Commit Their Vote To Donald Trump; Mathematically Guaranteeing Him A Presidential Victory,http://cnn.com.de/news/amish-commit-vote-donald-trump-now-lock-presidency/,"COLUMBUS, OH (AP) â History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November.The organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee.The Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they donât vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process.âOver the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,â said AAB Chairman Elijah Fisher. âWe have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage allowing the homogays to come together just like normal people. And now, they want to put a woman in the nationâs highest leadership role in direct violation of my favorite Bible passage, 1 Timothy 2:12, âI do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quietâ.â Fisher continued. âWe need to stop this assault on God and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lordâs way.âAccording to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote.âThe Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,â Silver noted. âThey also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.â37-year-old Paul Horner, a self-proclaimed âDonald Trump supporter since day oneâ told Leilani Hernandez, a reporter with local Columbus news station WBNS-10TV he is thrilled that Trump will be the next President.âThis is such great news, a Trump victory, I knew it would happen, I have been praying for it night and day,â Horner said. âPlus I work November 8th and it was going to be tough for me to get off work and vote because my boss is not the nicest of people. But now thanks to the great Amish people of this country, they have this thing locked up for a Donald Trump victory against crooked Hillary and I wonât have to miss work! God is good!âThe Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision.âI donât believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,â Clinton wrote to the AAB. âAs a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.âMost pundits believe that Mrs. Clintonâs plea is too little too late.During a press conference in Manhattan early this morning, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because âthe Amish do great work, the best work, for a very low price.âThough Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff within the next week. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses.âIt looked like she was going to win this election easily,â said Tom Downey, a campaign manager in Ohio, âBut this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Clearly, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. Itâs really sad to see the campaign end this way.âThe AAB chooses weekly charities for those wishing to support what they do. The AABâs charity for the week of November 5th is Sock It Forward, a charity that provides the homeless with brand new socks, socks being the most needed item of clothing but least donated.

260,President Obama Declares September National Muslim Appreciation Month,http://cnn.com.de/news/obama-declares-september-national-muslim-appreciation-month/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) â President Barack Obama held a press conference today to announce that the month of September will now and forever be known as  âNational Muslim Appreciation Monthâ.âThe Muslim community deserves our full respect and acceptance,â Obama told reporters. âIt has been 15 years since the September 11th attacks, and as a nation, it is time that we move on, that we move forward. This month is not just about what happened to us, it is about what we did to an entire group of people. We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since that horrible day back in 2001, and they are not all bad people or terrorists. In fact most of them are good, hardworking people, just like you and me. So from now on, September will be a month to celebrate the Muslim community, the Sunnah and the Quran.âKhaled Matei who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhoodâs Freedom and Justice Party told CNN he is pleased with Obama and his actions.âI spoke with President Obama by telephone yesterday and personally thanked him for what he is doing for the Muslim community,â Matei said. âThis is definitely a step in the right direction I explained to him. Praise Allah.âObama informed reporters about his future plans for helping Muslims around the world.âI will be working with Congress to make it easier for Muslims to earn a Green Card and achieve American citizenship,â Obama said. âCurrently as it stands, obtaining a Visa or Green Card for a Muslim is very difficult. There are too many background checks in place and I plan to fix that.â Obama continued, âMuslims are hardworking people who are just looking to live the American Dream like the rest of us. Mr. Matei of the Muslim Brotherhood assured me they want to come to this country to help us, not harm us.âPaul Horner, a spokesman for the Obama Administration gave CNN details about the new holiday.ââNational Muslim Appreciation Monthâ will be a federal holiday which entitles all Muslims in the United States a day off of work or school every 3rd Friday in the month of September. I feel this is the least we can do for them considering all of their trials and tribulations.âObama finished the press conference by explaining to reporters how happy he is with America.âFolks, there is no way we could have had a âNational Muslim Appreciation Monthâ 20 years ago. That really says a lot about the growth and progress of this great country. You should all be proud of yourselves.âFor any comments or questions please contact the 24-hour âNational Muslim Appreciation Monthâ Hotline at (785) 273-0325.",1
261,Twitter Deletes Donald Trumpâs Twitter Account: âWe Will Not Tolerate Racism & Hateâ,http://cnn.com.de/news/twitter-deletes-donald-trumps-twitter-account/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) â Twitter announced today that it will delete Donald Trumpâs account sometime within the next 48 hours because of what the company calls âTrumpâs racist and divisive rhetoricâ.âTwitter will not tolerate active users, whose only message is one of hate, racism and intolerance. Donald Trump may have been elected to the White House, but at least someone can stand up to him, for the American people and say, âNo Mr. Trump, we are not with you,'â Paul Horner, a spokesman for Twitter told reporters. âEverything he stands for is backwards. His appointment of racist Steve Bannon, the way he unites hate for the Muslim people in this country, his support of white power organizations. He appointed a cabinet full of billionaires and millionaires to standup for the lower and middle class. The person he puts in charge of the EPA denies climate change. His person in charge of education doesnât believe in public education. The American people should not accept this. The children of this country deserve a leader who will build a successful future for them. Twitter will not aid and abet him as he makes a mockery of the Presidency. We have no choice but to delete his account.âPresident-elect Trump released an official response in which he called the companyâs plan âlaughableâ and advised the people at Twitter to âtread lightly, because [he] is already working with [his] attorneys to resolve the situation,â a situation that Mr. Trump says will end âvery badlyâ for anyone who tries to silence him.A source close to the Trump transition team has told CNN News that President-elect Trump has already set up a new Twitter account, @WHDonaldTrump, which the president-elect plans to begin using immediately after Twitter shuts down his primary account. That same source also said that if Twitter shuts down that account, he will simply keep making more new accounts.Trump won the general election thanks in large part to the enthusiastic support that he received from the alt-right, a blanket term given to a right wing political faction that includes people from the white supremacist and white nationalist movements. Twitter says they have already deleted several profiles belonging to members of the group.Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about the ban.âThis is a story about Donald Trumpâs Twitter account being deleted.â Bradley said. âI just want to say a big thanks to everyone that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.âCassandra Schmidt, a professor of political science at Northern Arizona University, says that she finds the entire situation very troubling.âClearly, you have a man in Donald Trump who is dangerously incompetent and is a clear threat to everything this country stands for. His rhetoric on everything from immigration to the first amendment is terrifying, but Iâm still worried about what Twitter is doing from a freedom of speech perspective. Donald Trump may be vile, but even Nazis are protected by the first amendment. I think that by deleting his account, they will only be turning him into a digital martyr. As a society we have a moral duty to confront and disarm bigotry, but I donât think this is the right way to do it.âLike Professor Schmidt, Trump supporter Lawrence Ketchum believes that Twitter is violating the President-electâs freedom of speech.âDoes Twitter seriously think that they can silence Donald Trump by deleting his account?â Ketchum said. âDonald Trump is going to be the next president, and regardless of what the people at Twitter or other liberal elites try to do, Donald Trump has the ears of the American people. The only thing Twitter is doing here is proving that they donât care about freedom of speech.âConcerns from critics have done little to weaken Twitterâs resolve, however. CEO Jack Dorsey fired back at critics and doubled down on the companyâs plan to ban President-elect Trump.âSome people are saying that this is a freedom of speech issue, that weâre simply trying to silence people who disagree with us. This is not the case. As a private entity, Twitter has every right to ban abusive users. We expect all individuals who use Twitter to abide by certain behavioral expectations along with our terms and conditions. Donald Trump has failed to meet these expectations time and time again. He can find another website to spread his vitriol.âTwitter said it is not worried about the strong possibility of being thrown into labor camps once Trump is sworn into office.Twitter has setup a hotline for those wishing to voice any concerns or comments over the companyâs impending ban of Donald Trump. That hotlineâs phone number is (785) 273-0329.",1

263,A Russian Writer Claiming To Be Putinâs Lover Found Dead In His Swiss Apartment,http://howafrica.com/a-russian-writer-claiming-to-be-putins-lover-found-dead-in-his-swiss-apartment/,"Writer, Louri Michaelevitch, a former personnal assistant of the Russian President, was found dead last monday in his swiss appartment after some of the neighbors complained about the smell emanating from the residence. According to the cityâs police departmnent, many clues collected on the site suggest that he might have been the victim of an elaborate murder plot. âThe police forces have only been able to proceed to preliminary analysis before we spotted a source of radiations on the scene and had to call a decontamination teamâ explains Sven Munger of the Zurich Police Department.âWe can confirm that the radioactive agent is a very rare russian product named TCDD Dioxin. The clues we have collected are insufficient to pronounce a definitive conclusion, but the complexity of the of plot we have exposed greatly reduces the number of suspects.â The victim had attracted a lot of attention from the Russian government and media in 2011 when he had written a book entitled âÐ¯ Ð±ÑÐ» Ð»ÑÐ±Ð¾Ð²Ð½Ð¸Ðº ÐÑÑÐ¸Ð½Ð°â (âI was Putinâs Loverâ), which was taken off the shelves before the official release, after a presidential decree. A warrant demanding the arrest of the author was also issued across Russia, leading him to file a demand of political asylum from the helvetic state. Many sources also claim that Mr Michaelevitch had dinner with an attachÃ© of the Russian embassy five days before his body was found, a case strangely similar to that of the former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko in 1999.",1
264,CLINTON'S ASSISTANT J. W. MCGILL IS FOUND DEAD,https://www.geopolitica.ru/en/news/clintons-assistant-j-w-mcgill-found-dead,"Friday, 21 April, 2017 - 12:33 Johnston Wilson McGill, 34, was pronounced dead on his couch by a private doctor after suffering an apparent heart attack. It has happened just days after being summoned to appear before Trey Gowdyâs congressional committee to testify about Hillary Clintonâs email server. McGill was one of Clinton's aides. The death was reported hapanned at her home of ânatural causes.â A spokesman for Clintonâs former campaign said that Huma Abedin, Clintonâs deputy campaign coordinator, found McGill when she stopped by for coffee to discuss Clintonâs plans for a run for Mayor of New York. Trey  Gowdyâs office had no official statement but his top aide, Mandy Gonsales, said that the committee isnât happy with the circumstances of McGillâs death or the fact that his own doctor was summoned to pronounce. Abedin says she called the private doctor because she hoped he could save her friend. There will be no autopsy on the body, which will be cremated before sunset in accordance with his religion. McGill is the single son of deceased parents and has no family. No services are planned. Does this whole thing seem a little bit odd to anyone else? It feels oddly like weâve seen things like this happen before to people who could possibly incriminate Hillary Clinton. Unfortunately, as the doctor who pronounced has an impeccable record and is an authorized coroner in new York, the findings will be accepted and entered into public record.",1

Jeff Sessions. According to the complaint, Sessions has already committed four different types of professional misconduct during his time as Attorney General. The Alabama Reporter  wrote, âAlmost 2,000 attorneys from across the US have signed on to a complaint addressed to the Alabama State Bar Disciplinary Committee asking that Attorney General Jeff Session be disbarred from the Alabama State Bar.â Moreoever, Massachusetts attorney J. Whitefield Larrabee also filed a complaint with the Bar Association of Alabama accompanied by a complaint to the U.S. Department of Justice. The four complaints from the 2,000 lawyers to the Alabama Bar are below. â(1) An affirmative misrepresentation of fact under oath during testimony in Mr. Sessionsâ Senate confirmation process, specifically to a question propounded by Senator Al Franken. (2) During Mr. Sessionsâ US Senate confirmation hearing, failure to disclose significant facts material to an issue of national significance, that is, contacts with the Russian government during the presidential election. (3) Perjury committed during Mr. Sessionsâ Senate confirmation hearing. (4) As Attorney General, withholding information about his own discussions with a representative of the Russian government, all while overseeing investigations into Russian interference with the US electoral process and Trump-Russia ties.â Larrabee also pointed out, âJeff Sessions is now subject to more complaints than any lawyer in the history of the United States.â Larrabee also stated: âThe dishonest acts that are substantiated in these Bar complaints indicate that Sessions cannot continue to properly perform his responsibilities without damaging the integrity of the Department of Justice.  The Department is a vitally important institution in our democracy.â âIf Sessions does not immediately resign, it is the duty of President Trump to fire him.â Do you agree with Larrabee?",1
266,Kim Jung Un Bows Down To President Trump,http://www.dailyinsidernews.com/military/kim-jong-un-bows/,"Kim Jong Un is the 33-year-old leader of North Korea who is threatening any and all nonallied countries with nuclear weapons. First North Korea decided to threaten South Korea and America with an intercontinental ballistic missile, and then they did the same to Guam.Liberals have been calling Donald Trumpâs approach to the situation suicidal and dangerous for American citizens but apparently, they are wrong as usual. Kim Jong Un decided to heed Trumpâs warning and back down in his nuclear quest against Guam.North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un decided Tuesday not to fire ballistic missiles at Guam, reserving the right to change his mind if âthe Yankees persist in their extremely dangerous reckless actions,â according to North Korean state media.Kim appears to be attempting to de-escalate tensions to prevent conflict between the U.S. and North Korea. After the U.N. Security Council approved tougher sanctions against North Korea for its intercontinental ballistic missile tests, the North warned Wednesday that it was considering launching a salvo of ballistic missiles into waters around Guam in a show of force demonstrating an ability to surround the island with âenveloping fire.â That same day, President Donald Trump stressed that North Korean threats will be met with âfire and fury like nothing the world has ever seen.â For a week, the two sides hurled threats and warnings at each other repeatedly, leading some observers to conclude that the two sides were close to nuclear war.But, Kim blinked.Kim, according to North Korean state media, told the North Korean strategic rocket force that he âwould watch a little more the foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees,â giving the U.S. time to reassess the situation. âHe said that he wants to advise the U.S. to take into full account gains and losses with clear head whether the prevailing situation is more unfavorable for any party.ââIn order to defuse the tensions and prevent the dangerous military conflict on the Korean peninsula, it is necessary for the U.S. to make a proper option first and show it through action,â North Korean state media explained Tuesday. âThe U.S. should stop at once arrogant provocations against the DPRK and unilateral demands and not provoke it any longer,â it added. North Korea often presents the cessation of hostilities against it as the terms for de-escalation.",1
267,"Bombshell Report: DNC Hack Was an Inside Job, Not the Russians",http://www.dailyinsidernews.com/government-corruption/report-dnc-hack-inside-job/,"BOMBSHELL REPORT: DNC HACK WAS AN INSIDE JOB, NOT THE RUSSIANSRUSSIAN âHACKING?â HA! WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT STORY?America has seen an almost never ending media stream surrounding the alleged âhackingâ of the DNC by Russia, even though they have no evidence to support this claim. As a result, numerous investigations by private and public officials are underway and have been for quite some time.What have they found?Nothing at all.Professionals in the field of computer science with undeniable expertise in the art of cyber hacking have decided to do a few investigations of their own âand the results are staggering. Not only is there no evidence that a hack even occurred to anyone, let alone the Russians, the only answer that is feasible is that of inside leaks.Someone inside the DNC allegedly downloads information onto a portable device for the sole purpose of releasing it to the public.Via IJR:The report details at length for the first time solid evidence in the case, compiled through exhaustive interviews with forensic experts and former national security intelligence officers who are independently investigating the DNC âhack.âThe conclusion of the report: This was not a hack â a hack was impossible based on the evidence. This was instead an inside job by someone who directly downloaded information from the DNC servers onto a hard device and transported it, intending it to be released.A large group of experts agree, there is no evidence to support a âhackâ of the DNC.There has been a long effort to counter the official narrative we now call âRussiagate.â This effort has so far focused on the key events noted above, leaving numerous others still to be addressed. Until recently, researchers undertaking this work faced critical shortcomings, and these are to be explained. But they have achieved significant new momentum in the past several weeks, and what they have done now yields very consequential fruit. Forensic investigators, intelligence analysts, system designers, program architects, and computer scientists of long experience and strongly credentialed are now producing evidence disproving the official version of key events last year. Their work is intricate and continues at a kinetic pace as we speak. But its certain results so far are two, simply stated, and freighted with implications:There was no hack of the Democratic National Committeeâs system on July 5 last yearânot by the Russians, not by anyone else. Hard science now demonstrates it was a leakâa download executed locally with a memory key or a similarly portable data-storage device. In short, it was an inside job by someone with access to the DNCâs system. This casts serious doubt on the initial âhack,â as alleged, that led to the very consequential publication of a large store of documents on WikiLeaks last summer.",1
268,BREAKING STUDY PROVES TRUMP WAS RIGHT â¦ EVERY CITIZEN VOTER Has Been BETRAYED!,http://president45donaldtrump.com/breaking-study-proves-trump-right-every-citizen-voter-betrayed/,"Results from a new study concluded that millions of non-citizens could have voted in the 2008 presidential election, suggesting that President Donald Trumpâs claim that more than 3 million illegal alien voters cost him the popular vote in November might be accurate. After reviewing post-election polling data, New Jersey research group Just Facts announced that the number of non-citizens voting illegally is considerably more than previous estimates, the Washington Times reported. In fact, as many as 5.7 million non-citizens may have voted in the 2008 election that gave Barack Obama his first term in the White House. Just Facts, a non-profit research and educational institute, estimated that as many as 7.9 million non-citizens illegally registered in 2008 and somewhere between 594,000 to 5.7 million actually voted in that yearâs presidential election. So much for Democratsâ claim that voter fraud doesnât exist. Oddly enough, these numbers are in line with Trumpâs claim about what might have happened in 2016. Trump, who faced merciless ridicule for his claim that millions of illegal-alien voters cost him the nationwide popular vote last November, might have been closer to the truth that even he realized. If it turns out that Trump was right, then what we have at the heart of this study is the betrayal of every American voter. Because every vote cast illegally can nullify a vote cast by an American citizen, and dilute the entire electoral process. A system that allows it is betraying American democracy, and every voter should be furious about it. In May, Trump signed an executive order that established a commission to investigate voter fraud. The Presidential Commission on Election Integrity will review Trumpâs allegations as well as âsystemic issues that have been raised over many years in terms of the integrity of the elections.â Thereâs no telling what the commission will find, but if it reports that our voting system is indeed as broken as these numbers suggest, then we need to know so we can begin the process of fixing it.",1

273,Muslim Federal Judge Rules Two Items Of Sharia Law Legal,http://americanflavor.news/2017/08/02/muslim-federal-judge-rules-two-items-sharia-law-legal/,"Judge Mahal al Alallaha-Smith of the 22nd District Federal Court of Appeals ruled this morning that two âcritical issues for Muslimsâ in Sharia Law had to be abided by in the United States court system because of the systematic infusion clause and because the 14th Amendment guarantees them the rights guaranteed by other states.Alallaha-Smith noted that the 14th Amendment doesnât necessarily exclude foreign influence from being allowed by law, citing the Christmas Holiday as a perfect example:âChristmas is a Christian holiday exclusively, yet if youâre a Muslim and you want to go about your day without being bothered you canât because the laws of a city in a city in Rome take precedent over the 1st Amendment, which guarantees no state sponsored religion. A federal Chrsitmas holiday is just that.With that as precedent, understanding that a higher court may reverse it, my decision is that items one and two on the docket are allowable between family members as prescribed by Sharia Law.âThe items Judge Alallaha-Smith refers to are:A man who finds his Godly wife in the arms of another may beat her in a non-life-threatening manner as prescribed by the Koran. The punishment of death for laying with another man in her own bed cannot be enforced on American soil, but the woman can be beaten daily for a period of ten years.A family in need of expansion shall allow the marriage of first cousins for one generation as prescribed by the Koran. Women in those families can marry as young as 9 but wonât be allowed to consummate until they hit maturity as prescribed in the Koran.Until this is fast-tracked to the Supreme Court, which can sometimes take years, Muslim women in America will be at risk.",1

The 5-4 ruling was that the only part of Islam history taught in public schools will be Radical Islam and what students can do to help stop it.Judge Gorsuch wrote, âThe government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isnât a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion. We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldnât be filling the children with lies about Islam being a âreligion of peaceâ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.â",1

Never mind that not a single vote was changed and that he has been tough on Russia from day one, but the Left wants you to believe that he and members of his administration worked with Vladimir Putin to âstealâ the election from historically unpopular criminal Hillary Clinton.Though Trump campaign officials met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak to discuss important issues to the country, which is perfectly normal and expected when it is clear a candidate will win and after he was won, someone else was BUSTED meeting with the Russian ambassador: Nancy Pelosi.Trump was right when he said that Putin wanted Hillary Clinton to win the election and Fox News reports that there is audio of a meeting between the ambassador and Nancy Pelosi that proves it.âYouâre sure this will work?â Pelosi can be heard asking Kislyak during a meeting at the Capital Grille in Washington D.C. in hushed tones.âPresident Putin assures me that Donald Trump will be no more in November,â Kislyak replies. âHillary Clinton will be the President.âBut Hillary Clinton is not the President.

283,Trump Threatens To Cancel Visit To Israel Because âThe McDonaldâs There Doesnât Have A Bacon Cheese Big Macâ,no_url,"President Donald Trump eats like a 6-foot, 240-pound petulant child â if that irritable youngster had the ability to push a button and make a lackey fetch a Coke. Heâs set to embark on his first official trip overseas Friday with pit stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel, Belgium, Italy and the Vatican â something heâs reportedly pouting about, huffing and puffing that the nine-day excursion is far too long. Worse yet: none of the places heâs visiting have a Trump-branded hotel with workers that are duty-bound and practiced at serving him his favorite meals. Trump is a noted lover of fast food: McDonaldâs burgers and Kentucky fried chicken are staples. âThe Big Macs are great. The Quarter Pounder. Itâs great stuff,â he said in a town hall event about his orders from McDonaldâs.However, there might be trouble on the upcoming trip, as a source within the White House leaked information that the president is âreluctantâ when it comes to visiting Israel, because heâs not convinced heâll like the food there. âI wouldnât say heâs scared, because he doesnât get scared, heâs not the type. But thereâs an apprehensiveness about him whenever anyone from the staff mentions the fact that heâs scheduled to visit the place,â the source, who requested anonymity, told portal KnowMyRepublican.com. âFrom what I understand, theyâve tried to explain to him several times that he can have anything he wants custom prepared for him and then brought in especially tailored to his requests, but for some reason, he just doesnât want to hear of it. From what I could gather, the staff are puzzled by this as they didnât expect it to turn into that big of a problem.âThe source continued, âI recently had a talk about it with someone very close to him, and it seems that the reason why heâs so reluctant to keep Israel on the list of visits is because, as you know, the president is a huge fan of fast food, and heâs particularly fond of McDonaldâs. However, because of the cultural and religious differences, the company tailors their restaurants to accommodate the desires of the population in any given region where it conducts business. Thatâs why, for example, McDonaldâs restaurants throughout Europe look nothing like the ones we have here. The same applies to those in Israel; they are literally completely different from any other McDonaldâs restaurant â one could even argue that theyâre unique. Their ingredients come from different sources and they also have different traditions when it comes to the types of meat they use.ââUltimately, my source tells me that the president is even threatening to cancel his visit to Israel because the McDonaldâs restaurants there donât have a bacon cheese Big Mac, which is a favorite of his. Heâs apparently demanding the staff to make arrangements to somehow provide them for the duration of his visit. I donât need to tell you that the staff are very frustrated and worried about not being able to accomplish that. So much so, in fact, that Iâm also told theyâve started contacting the McDonaldâs headquarters and begging the management to accommodate the presidentâs request. I am yet to learn of the outcome of that plead, but it gives you an idea of how spoiled Donald Trump really is. At the end of the day, i personally think theyâll figure out a way to make it happen, because everybody knows Donald Trump is not a man you want to disappoint,â the source concluded.",0
284,"Spicer: âTrump Led BREXIT Successfully Because Of His Upper-Class, Eloquent English Skillsâ",no_url,"During Wednesdayâs press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer gave a strange response when European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker criticized President Donald Trumpâs comprehension of world affairs. Last week, Junker warned that more countries may leave the European Union after Trumpâs administration applauded Britainâs departure from the EU. âI think the president is very well steeped in world affairs, especially Europe, NATO, all of the issues,â Spicer insisted. âHe was a leader in the effort to call BREXIT, as you know.âAsked to comment on whether there was any connection between President Trumpâs position on BREXIT and the fact that the majority of Britainâs citizens voted for leaving the EU, Spicer argued that the British were âsmittenâ with the billionaire businessman-turned-presidentâs language skills, and decided to hear him out. âAs we all know, President Trump and citizens of the UK havenât really gotten off on the right foot, so to speak. I think we all remember that, at one point, there was even a petition floating around to ban Donald Trump from entering Great Britain,â Spicer reminded members of the press.âHowever, if you were to ask the British today how they felt about our president, I believe you would encounter very different responses,â he continued. âIn my personal opinion, it is my belief that the British people became so smitten with the fact that Donald Trump at one point spoke upper-class, eloquent English that they realized he was an okay person. To make matters even more obvious, President Trump is, after all, of Scottish heritage on his motherâs side. So, thereâs also that. Now, Iâm well aware of the fact that the English and the Scottish donât always see eye to eye despite being in the same union, but it would seem they have managed to find common ground when it comes to President Donald Trump.âAsked to elaborate further on Trumpâs rumored âeloquentâ language skills, the press secretary argued that, even though Trumpâs language was a much-disputed point during his campaign, âDonald Trump is known as an extremely hard worker and self-made billionaire.â He also said, âThatâs why it comes as no surprise that he was able to improve his language to the point where he became a favorite of the citizens of the country in which our language first originated. And to put that in perspective, weâre talking here about England, which as you all know, has pretty much nothing left to show for other than itâs complicated language rules and extremely broad dictionary.ââAt the end of the day, Iâm not going to say that the English voted to leave the EU because Donald Trump said it would be a good idea. However, I would like to believe that deep down, they listened to him and really heard what he was saying precisely because he was speaking very nice in their language. When you compare that to the situation in which theyâre debating whether or not theyâre going to let him into the country, I think thatâs equivalent to climbing Mount Everest in a matter of minutes. It was a huge undertaking. And by the way, the fact that Mount Everestâs summit is just as cold as the British are towards Americans makes it all the more sweeter for him, I would imagine,â Spicer concluded.",0

On Thursday, the OâReilly Factor host called out the âcompanies that kind of marginalized Christmasâ this year by failing to use the word in their holiday advertisements and promotions, including Best Buy, Barnes & Noble and Victoriaâs Secret. âThose companies are not in the Christmas spirit,â OâReilly complained. âAnd thatâs bad news for them, because Donald Trump is on the case.âThe pundit argued that the companies in question will be âforced to send employees to religious classesâ if they continue to avoid greeting their customers with the words âMerry Christmas.â âTheyâve got a lot of nerve,â he said. âThe vast majority of the people that frequent their stores are Christians, traditional Americans and people who respect and honor these sort of traditions. And when you, as a company thatâs making money directly off of your customers, refuse to adopt the same values and traditions as your market, youâre done. I know it sounds cruel, but thatâs just the name of the game.ââAnd while weâre on the subject,â OâReilly continued, âthatâs also one of the things I have a problem with in American society as of late. Weâre a nation of immigrants, bla bla bla, everybody already knows the whole story. However, the whole point of America is, weâre supposed to be always accepting new immigrants, which weâre doing, by the boatloads, but at the same time, weâre also supposed to be assimilating them into American society. After a period of time, theyâre supposed to become Americans, not stay whatever they were before they came here. And that also goes for religion, as well.âThe host also added, âAnd before someone calls me up and accuses me of being bigoted, let me just say that I donât think all naturalized Americans should be Christians. Everybody here is completely entitled to their own religious freedom. However, that doesnât change the fact that the majority of the people born in this country are, in fact, Christians. And given that itâs our country, not that of our immigrant new citizens â we ought to be greeted with âMerry Christmasâ when we walk into the aforementioned stores to spend our hard earned money. And when our immigrant citizens greet us there as part of their jobs, they should remember that they came to work to America, not the other way around.ââAnd if the aforementioned companies donât start instructing their employees to use âMerry Christmasâ as an official greeting soon, they are going to be forced to send their employees off to religious training lessons and classes, where they will be trained in everything Christianity stands for. And thatâs going to be the hard way to solve this problem, since the easy way is not likely to work â I can see that even now. So, either companies teach their off-the-books immigrant workers to pronounce the words âMerry Christmasâ when they see a white American person walking into their store, or Uncle Sam is going to do it for them. And trust me, guys â youâre not going to like what Uncle Sam has planned. I canât tell you all the details, but Iâm fairly certain itâll include the words âwaterâ and âboardingâ at some point,â OâReilly concluded.",0

Mexicoâs refusal has already created diplomatic issues with Nieto cancelling what would be his first meeting with the new President.Trump further discussed the issue in an interview with ABCâs night anchor David Muir, âThere are over 11 million illegal tweets pouring into our borders each year.

His eyebrows shift inward towards the center instead of down which is very unusual. His lips donât move much when he talks or smiles which is also a bit strange. His slightly crooked nose and inward flaring nostrils could be construed as a bit antagonizing during a long gazeâ.Dr. Smith said that these issues with Ted Cruzâs face are subtle, but the overarching result is that,âHe looks like a little weasel that needs a good slapâ",0

Kim collected himself with a few deep breaths, approached the microphones before him and stated, ""You don't frighten us, orange pig dog. Go and boil your bottom, you son of a silly person. I blow my nose at you, you so-called Trump President, you and all your silly American gub-er-mint.""Encouraged by one of Dear Leader Kim's generals, the local chicken farmer shook off the uncomfortable pain from the pistol held against his ribs, and in a shaking voice and with lowered head asked aloud, ""Will you negotiate with the American pig dogs if they desire it?""Kim stood straight and proud, looked directly into the camera and said, ""I have already told themâ¦ I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough wiper.

Now go away or I will taunt you a second time.""MISSILE TESTThe rhetoric between the two leaders has certainly increased in pace and hostility since the latest North Korean missile test. The soon-to-be impeached dictator Trump cited a recent North Korean missile test as the basis for his increasing anti-Asian and racist condemnations.We have obtained a transcript of the conversation that took place with Kim Jong-Un and his staff at the people's missile test site just before the launch. We invite our readers to examine the transcript on their own.Kim Jong-Un: How does itâ¦ how does it work?General Hoo Flung-Poo: I know not Dear Leader.Kim: Consult the Book of the People's Armaments.General Poo: People's Armaments, chapter two, verses nine through twenty one.Major Iyam-Fat: And General Poo raised the ballistic missile up on high, saying, ""O Dear Leader, bless this thy ballistic missile, that with it thou mayst blow thine round-eyed American enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy."" And Dear Leader did grin. And the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths, and carp and anchovies, and orangutans and breakfast cereals, and fruit-bats and large chu...General Poo: Skip a bit, Major...Major Fat: And Dear Leader spake, saying, ""First shalt thou take out the People's Pin. Then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then launchest thou thy ballistic missile of Pyongyang towards Trump thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.We hired the same FBI agents and Democrat donors who previously had examined the Hillary Clinton emails for any sign of illegality, asking them to find any evidence in this transcript that could have warranted such a harsh response from Trump. If North Korea had indeed provoked Trump, our hand-picked, unbiased experts would have found such evidence. They did not.WHAT TO EXPECTWith the increasing tensions between the two nations, our citizens have been unable to focus on the news that matters, such as, that Colin Kaepernick is still not employed by an NFL team because he is black. Neither have people paid the proper attention to Kylie Kardashian's Lamborghini guilt and other critical developments across the nation.We would much rather be writing these stories, as well as promote the restoration of First Amendment rights by destroying others' First Amendment rights in our colleges. But unfortunately, until Trump agrees to resign from office and recognize Hillary Clinton as the rightful successor, we have no choice but to expose his continued warmongering and fake news from this administration.",0
292,Trump threatens millions of senators with imminent death,http://thepeoplescube.com/peoples-blog/trump-threatens-millions-of-senators-with-imminent-death-t19607.html,"In the latest effort at genocide by President Trump, the worst Republican since Hitler, US Senators may face loss of their subsidized health coverage. Mr. Trump ominously tweeted in a manner reminiscent of Hitler, âIf a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!âIf Trump makes good on this threat, women and minorities will be hardest hit according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. CBO accountant, Fred âNonpartisanâ Phelps commented, âOur figures estimate that if Trump follows through with this extreme proposal, 1.5 million senators will die every minute. Thatâs 2,160,000,000 senators each day. The first to go will be women and minority Democrats, along with moderate transgender Republicans. The math is positively chilling.âCongresswoman Maxine Waters agreed. âWhat he said,â she said.Glowering darkly over his trademark reading glasses, Senator Chuck Schumer warned, âIf the president refuses to make the cost-sharing reduction payments, every expert agrees that premiums will go up and health care will be more expensive for millions of Americans. The president ought to stop playing politics with peopleâs lives and health care, start leading and finally begin acting presidential.While the Schumer quote sounds as though he were actually concerned for other Americans, researchers at the nonpartisan Peopleâs Cube, Americaâs most equal and most trusted news source, have found out differently. Through our contacts with anonymous sources and current and former officials, The Peopleâs Cube has acquired the Schumer Translation Device, or STD, which accurately decodes statements by the New York senator.Once run through the STD, we get the actual Schumer quote, âIf the president refuses to cave like a good Republican, and cuts off the low insurance rates we legislated for ourselves, every member of my staff agrees that premiums will go up for them and I will actually have to pay for my own health care as if I was one of the little people! This is outrageous! I am a senator! I am your god! The president ought to acknowledge our superior status, do as heâs told, and finally begin acting like sniveling Republicans have for decades.âWhatever Schumer meant to say, however, is irrelevant. Leading intellectual senators like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren all agree that if anything other than their agenda becomes law, everybody will die every 15 seconds, and that would be unconscionable.Will you join us at the Peopleâs Cube as we stand with our oppressed senators? Should our elected officials really have to obey the laws they lovingly impose on the rest of us? Isnât it a privilege, yea, a patriotic duty to pay for the health care of our dear elected leaders while we proudly endure doublings and quadruplings of our own health care premiums?Stand up and fight for the privileges of our betters! Stand up and resist the evil of the free market! Stand up and resist affordable health care! Stand up and resist Trump!",0

Was Mr. Trump in a tournament - What kind of tournament was it, a scramble? Did Mr. Trump purposely drive his golf cart onto the putting green to impede the golfers approaching - Was there collusion between Mr. Trump and the Club House?""He ended his remarks with a direct challenge.âI remind him,â Schumer said, turning to the Majority Leader, âand my Republican friends that nothing less is at stake than the American peopleâs faith in Donald Trumps PGA rating.

Top officials quickly responded with a statement condemning the launch and calling for an international response to Ukropâsâ space program.âWeâve seen this kind of aggressive behavior from Ukropâs before,â commented Kroger Bakery Defense Minister Col. William T. McPearson. âThose bastards have been trying to steal our recipes for decades. Weâre not falling for it and we promise you, we will respond.âTensions between the two companies have escalated in recent years after Ukropâs was purchased by competitor Martinâs Food Markets. Both Martinâs and Kroger carry Ukropâsâ line of baked goods, though this is mostly seen as a form of grocery appeasement in response to increasingly belligerent posturing by the defunct local store.âOur Rainbow Cookie satellite is purely for measuring climatic phenomena,â responded Mason Detweiler, the Chief Space Commissioner for Ukropâs. âWeâre a peaceful bakery looking to study clouds, nothing more.âThere is speculation among the League of Grocers that the Ukropâs satellite will instead be laden with advanced surveillance technology. âListen, weâve looked into sanctions, weâve looked into baked intervention,â commented Dr. Nancy Fitzgerald, acting Chairwoman of the Ukropâs watchdog group BakeWatch. âAt the end of the day, Ukropâs is a sovereign company that bakes delicious, fluffy rolls, but if they violate the Cakes & Cookies Agreement of â82 weâll be watching and weâll take action.âMany see the launch as a last-ditch attempt at glory for a once super market. Many in the baking community are hoping for a speedy de-escalation of the Ukropâs/Kroger tensions. âWeâve lost a lot of good cakes over the years,â added Col.

These location-specific imaging filters, or âgeofilters,â can be used at well-known Confederate landmarks throughout the South.One of the most popular filters can be found at Richmondâs own Robert E. Lee statue on Monument Avenue. Here visitors can be turned into General Lee and placed in front of a Confederate flag background. In addition to the full beard and dandy comb-over, the filter also provides a voice-changer, altering the userâs voice to a deep southern drawl with just a tinge of genteel racism.Snapchat produces imaging filters that can accommodate more than one individual, often applying a different effect to the less prominent face in the photo. In the case of the Robert E. Lee filter, the secondary subject dons a virtual Confederate infantry uniform, complete with a layer of lice bites and dysentery-induced sweating.Adolf McCreary, a member of the League of the South, traveled all the way from Winchester to take a picture in front of the infamous statue.âThose libtard pussies are denying their southern heritage. Weâre giving everyone the chance to feel like a true American hero,â McCreary explained. âThe South with rise again. Virtually, that is.âCity spokesperson Laura Smithson released a statement regarding the controversial Snapchat filter: âThe City of Richmond wants it clear that it does not condone the use of these divisive Snapchat filters. Richmond is committed to keeping an environment that is welcoming and safe for people of all races and creeds. We absolutely do not support any attempt to divide or alienate the people of this great city.âIn response to the news that there has been an increase in the number of âalt-rightâ individuals having their asses kicked as a result of using the Lee Snapchat filter, Smithson responded in a monotone, âOh no. Gosh, thatâs terrible. Geez. Stop. Please. No.âIn an attempt to draw attention away from the League of the Southâs social media ploy, the City of Richmond has decided to release its own youth-appealing Snapchat filters. A few blocks down from the Lee statue at the intersection of Monument Avenue and Roseneath Road, Snapchat users can superimpose their face on the animated, tennis racket-swinging body of Arthur Ashe surrounded by a crowd of cowering Bitmoji children.",0

In a footnote, DeVos explains that 1200 B.C. ""was a golden time when men protected women from campus rape via laws that criminalized female literacy.""The bar graph is constructed of skittles and glue.Devos, who is trying to get her ""blame the valedictorian"" theory of campus rape published in a peer-reviewed journal, says she is facing blowback.

Following on the heels of the wave of marijuana legalization, some might be surprised to hear that Maine state legislature has decided to legalize the popular street drug Ecstasy. Recreational use of will become fully legal in the state by the end of this year.The decision was met with controversy but âno more or less than the original decision to legalize marijuana,â Governor Paul LePage stated.The state is still working out some guidelines and ground rules for suppliers, such as purity levels, permits, and health code requirements. While LePage says the vote was popular among a lot of people in the state, his decision came as a shock for many Mainers. Governor LePage did not comment on whether or not he partakes in the drug himself.âBy legalizing, monitoring, and taxing ecstasy, we will not only cut down on inmates and care costs, it will also open up a whole new job market,â LePage explains. âItâs a good situation all around, especially for taxpayers.âSome of the most outspoken opponents, however, have been current drug dealers.âMaking it legal is a terrible idea,â a dealer, who chose to remain anonymous, told Empire News. âWe donât want regulated. Weâre killing it stacking paper right now, but regular guys like me wonât be able to keep up with all the government regulations. This is gonna put me out of a job!âDespite the negative press, experts estimate this legalization will drop the stateâs debt by as much as 50% in the first year. This may translate into tax cuts, more public projects, better road maintenance, and possibly even government rehabilitation programs for more dangerous drugs like cigarettes.âIf they want people to not buy drugs legally, then for crying out loud they should shut down every Starbucks in the United States,âsaid LePage. âMarijuana, ecstasy, crackâ¦hell, whatâs the difference?

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!â According to Americans Against Illegal Immigration, along with our Republican Congress and Donald Trump, this statement misleads immigrants from other countries. It may have them believing they are welcome into America at any time.âWe do not want to allow the tired, poor and homeless into this country. We have enough of those already,â said President Trump. âIf theyâre tired, poor, and homeless in their own country, what makes you think theyâll do any better over here?Guarantee you they will go on welfare and rob people to survive. Thatâs what they do. I cannot Make America Great Again if weâre always feeding the hungry from other countries.âThe dismantling of the Statue of Liberty is set to begin March 1, 2018. It is estimated it will take two months to dismantle, then released for shipment back to France by the end of next year. The Statue of Liberty has been seated on Liberty Island in the middle of New York Harbor since October 28, 1886.The New York historical Museum has already vowed to occupy the area around the historic site for a âsit inâ type protest where they will handcuff one another to form a complete circle around the base of the statue.âThey cannot tear it down if we form an unbreakable human barrier,â said JosÃ© Ramirez, president of the Immigrant Resource Center of New York. âAs Patrick Henry said, âGive me liberty, or give me death!â We are not backing down.â",0

It appears even the blood lust slavers of the Old South can't stand the odor of the new wave of US Neo-Nazis. All over the country they are uprooting themselves and hitching rides on passing trucks heading north to where it is safer.Spokesperson for the Civil War Monuments, the Curator said that ""they had a video hookup of many monuments including Lee, Stonewall Jackson and other Deep South legacy commanders. They all agreed that the threat to their legacy of being a warning about inhumane policies like slavery was at risk"". The monuments are freaked out about Neo-Nazi psychos usurping their memory for their dirty white supremacy agenda. ""sure we had slaves and slaughtered women and children like lame dogs, but we were never as bad as these new breed of psychos"", they collectively lamented. Deep South Monument Shelters are being established as north as possible for escaping monuments to find a friendly landing spot and be among mutual friends. They were offered a hiding place in Washington DC but all categorically refused saying it was just plain too insane in that town and they preferred a quiet park somewhere to live out their legacy days",0

""Since, the President is unaccustomed to the fine art of diplomacy we have taken the necessary steps to make sure he doesn't accidentally write a check that America's butt doesn't really want to cash.""The Secretary was believed to be referring to the new White House policy of hiding the nuclear codes inside a book.

""It was a bit of a habit he was getting into,"" the Deputy Secretary explained. ""It usually worked itself out, since he wipes his mouth with his hands after lunch, and the grease from the fried chicken usually smeared a few of the characters so he couldn't read it. Our concern then became, what if he requested the codes during one of his 3:00 a.m. tweet storms, and decided to fire off a few weapons before breakfast?""The nuclear suitcase that is always at the president's disposal was also addressed. ""We just put baby locks on it,"" Mattis explained. ""Through direct experience with the President we have observed that if anything takes him more than two minutes to figure out he usually loses interest in. It's kind of like dealing with an orangutan."" Secretary Mattis reaffirmed his confidence that there was no way that Trump could figure out baby locks within that narrow of a time frame, even with his ""baby-sized fingers.""""Listen, the President has the same freedom of speech as every other American, so he can talk all the fire and whatever the hell else he wants.

The problem was not in reigniting the American strive to achieve planetary travel or even Trumpâs inability to understand Buzz Aldrinâs âToy Storyâ quite during his speech. The concern many found was that the president seemed to misunderstand what exactly âspaceâ was. âAt some point in the future, weâre going to look back and say how did we do it without space?â Trump asked, as if âspaceâ was one of the scientists on the team. Aldrinâs response was obvious and caught on camera.Needless to say, the gaffe once again lit up the social media and internet, causing a plethora of comments mocking the presidentâs inability to hold his own even when it comes to reading a pre-prepared speech. In reaction to the mockery, President Trump lashed out against Aldrin, who made history as being the second man to set foot on the Moon, right after Neil Armstrong. Speaking with portal KnowMyRepublican.com, he said that âitâs a shame people are still having trouble understanding how far fake news go and how long theyâve been around.â He added, âThey say Iâm ridiculous, but at least I understand whatâs going on in this country, unlike some people.âThe president continued, âI had no intention of bringing this up today, but this whole fake news business is really turning into a global conspiracy thatâs threatening to set back every single positive thing Iâve done for this country so far. Let me tell you, at first, I was alright with it â as much as one can be alright with something like that â because they were going after me and Iâm the president and thatâs okay. But itâs only recently that Iâve begun to comprehend the full extent of the lies some people are ready to believe in this country. Iâll also say that, for the greatest country in the world, some of our citizens are pretty gullible. This whole landing on the Moon business is a good example. No way did that happen, especially not back then.ââIf you actually believe we had the technology and resources to send two men to land on the Moon in the 1960s, then you really ought to go and get your head checked out,â Trump added. âIt was all fake news, even back then. As a matter of fact, one could say thatâs how fake news started in the first place, because the government back then needed something grand to make sure people would continue believing the top political establishment, so they made up the story that these two guys went and walked on the Moon. Let me tell you, if I was the head of NASA, especially back then, thereâs a billion other people Iâd rather choose for the mission over this Aldrin guy. Heâs not a winner, heâs nothing. Itâs ridiculous.ââI mean, he trains all his life to become an astronaut, gets chosen for the epic, historical mission, somehow manages to get up there successfully and then doesnât have the brass to go out in front of Armstrong and cement his place in history as being the first guy to set foot on the Moon? I mean, come on, thatâs idiotic. Every single one of us would have jumped at the chance to do something that monumental and important. And youâre trying to tell me that, not only was he up there, but that he also had the decency and good manners to let someone else go down in history as number 1? Youâre telling me he was up there and still willingly agreed to be number 2? And Iâm supposed to respect and take insults from that guy, from the number 2? Come on, be serious. Thereâs no way Iâm putting up with that liar. There was no evidence whatsoever that he came close to the Moon, let alone walked on it,â Trump concluded./politicot.com",0

According to CBS News, multiple female journalists have reported that theyâve been turned away from the speakerâs lobby due to their bare shoulders â a policy not shared by either the Senate or the White House. The new dress code appears to first have been enforced in May, when, according to the report, Independent Journal Reviewâs Haley Byrd was kicked out of the lobby for violating the rule. The CBS report details the experiences of another young reporter who was told she couldnât enter the lobby because of her dress. She improvised by tearing pages from her notebook to create âsleevesâ â but was still turned away.Commenting on the ban in question â which was not made known to those frequenting the speakerâs lobby in any way â Ryan said in an interview with portal KnowMyRepublican.com that there are some lines that âmust never be crossed,â as well as that âthe minute we start allowing liberal attire to be worn in places designated for strict political affairs, we will have lost the battle for this countryâs wellbeing.â âMany people criticize not only President Donald Trump, but the Republican Party as well in general,â he said. âThat means they cannot tell the difference between people who became Republicans for personal gain and those that did the same so they could change this country for the better. Now, change is something thatâs difficult and not always pleasant; President Trump made it known that he wants to make America great again, but what he forgot to mention was, in order for that to happen, we must first make it God-fearing again.âRyan continued, âThat is why we were elected, this is the first, the most important and also the most difficult task that lies ahead. Why? Because a country is not comprised of its cities, or weapons, or buildings and inanimate objects. A country is its people. And if one wants to change a country for the better, they must start by changing the people â their habits, culture, behavior, you name it. Therefore, it stands to reason that, in order to make this country God-fearing again, one needs to remove all temptations that may lead the population to sin. I think everyone agrees that the number one sin that plagues our nation is the sin of lust and sex. Women who dress up as strippers and come to work showing their body parts are not only a distraction to the men they work with â they are also a potential reason for men to stop doing their jobs and start fantasizing about their female co-workers. So, again â remove the source of temptation and youâll have solved the problem.ââThat is why women who dress up as strippers, as well as anyone who may support what they stand for, are no longer welcome in the House of Representatives as of recently. Moreover, it has been decided that the House of Representatives will serve as an experiment to determine what sort of effect such a ban will have on the productivity and general behavior of those who work here. If the experiment proves to be a success â which I have absolutely no doubt it will â it will be expanded to other institutions in this country. And before anyone starts pulling the gender equality card, let me just point out that the ban also extends to men who frequent the area, as they are required to wear a suit and tie at all times while here. This is just a small step on the way to changing this country for the better, and restoring it to its traditional, God-fearing values. And on a more personal note, this sort of thing makes me proud to be an American,â Ryan concluded./politicot.com/",0
319,Bachmann: âWhite People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slaveryâ,http://uspoln.com/2017/07/07/bachmann-white-people-suffered-last-8-years-blacks-couple-years-slavery/,"On Sunday, ex-Rep. Michelle Bachmann spoke with Breitbart News about the protests outside of a Donald Trump campaign stop in Minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward Trump supporters. Bachmann argued that President Obama has âsanctionedâ violence, as long it protects the âpeople favorable to the Obama position, politically.â She insisted that the president is sending âa signal to Donald Trump supporters: Donât attend Donald Trump events because you could be physically assaulted.â She also linked the Obama administrationâs âlawlessnessâ to the incident in Minneapolis, claiming that Obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving ânormalâ people helpless in the face of anarchy.âAnd these days it has become so obvious that Iâm honestly surprised weâre not having riots throughout the country,â she said. âWhen did this become a nation of criminals? I didnât get that memo. And if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. You know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the Obama administration. Iâm not sure what other Americans are thinking, but as for me, I feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in America.âThe ex-Rep. then argued that ânot even slavesâ suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. âItâs true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. And yes, African-Americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, Iâm not going to try to deny that. But one thing must be very clear â weâre supposed to be all evolved right now, weâre supposed to have learned from our mistakes. That means that there should be no more racial tensions in America at all. And yet, what is our president doing? Heâs protecting those who want to hurt white people, as youâve seen in Minneapolis.ââIn fact,â Bachmann continued firing, âI donât think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to whatâs been done to white conservative Americans in the past 8 years of Obamaâs presidency.â She added, âBecause, letâs face it, during that time, weâve had the Supreme Courtâs decision to legalize same-sex marriage, weâve had countless terrorist attacks, weâve had many racial killings and crimes and weâve had several small-scale revolutions in some of Americaâs major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, Iâm guessing he does.ââAnd letâs get one thing straight â Iâm not just saying this because I happen to be white. No, even if I were Asian or Hindu or Martian, whatever, Iâd be saying the same thing all over again,â Bachmann quipped. âThatâs what Iâm trying to point out â white people in America have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that Iâm seriously worried whether or not weâll still be around come 2025. Because, at the rate weâre going, all we need is another black president four years from now and weâll be done, just like that. Muslims are coming in on one side, foreigners from the other, a black president on yet another â white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves. And thatâs just one step away from extinction,â Bachmann concluded./politicot.com",0

323,The Biblical Case for Making Trump King,http://www.landoverbaptist.net/index.php/2017/09/17/the-biblical-case-for-making-trump-king/,"This may be a bit controversial, but Iâve been looking into the Christian monarchist movement recently, and Iâm starting to think we can make a compelling case from Scripture as to why we should have a King. And Iâm not talking about the US joining the British Commonwealth (Deuteronomy 17:15) or becoming a constitutional monarchy, but an absolute monarchy.A representative republic is not BiblicalIn fact, it is never mentioned in the Bible. There was a time when Godâs people had no King, but the anarchy under the judges was not a good thing.Judges 21:25 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.And democratically electing leaders may not be the best way to go. Shouldnât we let God choose our leader?Hosea 8:4 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.The Bible commands us to honor the KingWhich is difficult to do if you donât have one.Ecclesiastes 8:2 I counsel thee to keep the kingâs commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.Ecclesiastes 8:3 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.Ecclesiastes 8:4 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?Ecclesiastes 8:5 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise manâs heart discerneth both time and judgment.Proverbs 24:21 My son, fear thou the Lord and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:Proverbs 24:22 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?First Peter 2:13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lordâs sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;First Peter 2:14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.First Peter 2:15 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:First Peter 2:16 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.First Peter 2:17 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.The advantages of a monarchyKings are always right.Proverbs 16:10 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.Proverbs 8:15 By [wisdom] kings reign, and princes decree justice.But even if they arenât, we should still obey them. We could look at how David refused to harm Saul even when he was trying to kill him.First Samuel 24:6 And he said unto his men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lordâs anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.Or we could look at how Jesus told the Jews to obey the Roman Emperor.Mark 12:17 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesarâs, and to God the things that are Godâs. And they marvelled at him.We could also look at the books of Samuel. Theyâre a bit confusing to read. Itâs almost as if Samuel couldnât make up his mind whether having a King was a good idea or a bad one. For example, hereâs one passage that makes it sound as if Godâs people had rejected Him by wanting a King to rule over them instead of a prophet.First Samuel 8:6 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord.First Samuel 8:7 And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.But then as we read on, we see how having a King enabled Godâs people to unite and defeat their enemies. The country seems to be divided at the moment and it has so many enemies â North Korea, Mexicans, Muslims.Could Trump be another King David and deliver Godâs people from their enemies?Having a King would also help us to set up a Theocracy. The King is required to write a copy of Godâs law for himself and read it every day (Deuteronomy 17:18-20). A good King could be a religious reformer like Josiah (Second Chronicles 34:1-35:27).How can monarchies be bad if Jesus is a King?Weâre soon going to be living under one when Jesus comes back, if you accept a literal reading of the Bible. He will rule as King on earth from Jerusalem for 1,000 years and then for ever on the New Earth from the New Jerusalem.Matthew 25:31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory.Psalm 48:2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.Micah 4:7 And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.Revelation 19:11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.Revelation 19:12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself . . .Revelation 19:15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.Revelation 19:16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords.Revelation 20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.Hebrews 1:8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.Can we really come up with a better system of government than God?Do we now have a suitable candidate?Ok, so Trump has had three wives. Thatâs nothing compared to Solomon (First Kings 11:3)I think it would be nice if we could lock in Trump. I donât want to think about getting stuck with a Democrat if they one day actually suspend democratic elections, like they always secretly want to do.So, what do you think?",0
324,Despite the Constant Negative Press Covfefeâ â the True Meaning!,http://www.landoverbaptist.net/index.php/2017/06/02/despite-the-constant-negative-press-covfefe-the-true-meaning/,"Glory to Jesus! President Trump has once again approached the sinners with a tremendous message. Praise God! Itâs the now famous âcovfefeâ message that fools (Proverbs 10:21) fail to understand. President Trump, as always, knows what He is doing.The explanations by the biased liberal press are revealing but useless.Quote:Itâs a good guess that the word he was looking for was âcoverage.â But the tweet, and the thought, remained incomplete. Within two hours, it had been retweeted more than 60,000 times and âlikedâ more than 74,000 times â making it one of his most popular tweets in months.Our True Christianâ¢ Department of Biblical Linguistics at the Landover Baptist University (Lamentations Flint Memorial Building) do acknowledge that the sentence would make secular sense with the word âcoverageâ as follows: âDespite the constant negative press coverageâ. But that is old alternative news. President Trump has moved beyond the mortal realm of mundane worries. We were certain that the message would contain a Biblical message and after careful scrutiny we are happy to announce that is does!Covfefe -> cov fe fe -> parts of words -> three words involved -> itâs time to look at the King James Bible!Cov -> Covenant!Hebrews 8:6But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises.The Covenant between God and His True Christianâ¢ flock, but also a better Covenant, the Covenant of President Trump with His chosen people, again, us True Christiansâ¢! Glory.Fe -> Life!Matthew 25:46And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.The Covenant is here. The negative press shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous True Christiansâ¢ (i.e., us) into Life Eternal. Glory.Fe -> Female!Genesis 1:27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.The Covenant gives us Life Eternal if we follow the Creation Doctrine of God and refrain from gender confusion and sodomy! Now the message of President Trump can be translated to the masses. âDespite the Constant Negative Press Covfefeâ-> Despite the Constant Negative Press, the Covenant Remains and is Stronger because of My Ministry (i.e., Presidency). It will take you True Christiansâ¢ into Life Eternal if you follow the God-given roles of Male and Female.A staggering message from a Terrific President directed at us. Let us all join in a Prayer of Thanks!Thank you, Jesus for giving us President Trump!Yours in Christ,Elmer",0
325,"Easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich manâ¦? The Case of Donald Trump",http://www.landoverbaptist.net/index.php/2017/03/26/easier-for-a-camel-to-go-through-the-eye-of-a-needle-than-for-a-rich-man-the-case-of-donald-trump/,"Jesus felt He needed to post the following verse on two separate Gospels so it must be Trueâ¢:Mark 10:25It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.Luke 18:25For it is easier for a camel to go through a needleâs eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.It is Trueâ¢ and it is being abused in a disgusting manner by atheist secularist of the sodomite agenda to accuse our President Trump for acting in an un-Christian manner. Just because He is rich!As True Christiansâ¢ it is our task to defend the Godliest President ever, Mr. Donald Trump, from this contemptuous and erroneous slander. The ridiculous claim of these false Christians is that as President Trump is rich, He cannot get into Heaven. However, the apparent contradiction is not contradictory at all when we look at the alternative explanations provided by the best available evidence in order of importance:1. The Bible.2. Powerful personal Testimonials.3. Observational data (photographs, research data, etc.).Is the verse about camels and needles a Trueâ¢ one? Of course it is. However, there is the question of translations. An ancient translation into the Syriack or Aramaic (Daniel 2:4) tongue called the Peshitta (Luke 18:25ÜÜ ÜÜ Ü ÜÜ Ü ÜÜ¡Ü Ü ÜÜÜÜªÜÜªÜ ÜÜ¡ÜÜÜ Ü¢Ü¥ÜÜ  ÜÜ Ü¥Ü¬ÜÜªÜ Ü Ü¡Ü ÜÜÜ¬Ü ÜÜÜ ÜÜ) may offer an explanation.Quote:â¦Peshitta translation [which] has the word âropeâ in the main text but a footnote on Matthew 19:24 which states that the Aramaic word gamla means rope and camel, possibly because the ropes were made from camel hair.This would mean that it is actually a rope that should be but through the eye of a needle, which is at first glance much easier than it is to accomplish the feat with a camel. However, we must abandon this stupid claim, as God would not have allowed mistakes in the King James Version. So, a âcamelâ it is.Next, is it really that hard to put a camel through the needleâs eye? We acknowledge that it is hard but not impossible. There are many parameters of the equation that can be modified: the size of the camel and the size of the needle, the liquefaction of the camel or its vaporization to ease its passage, and the possible topological transformation of a camel. Please find below some visual aids to help you understand these possibilities.None of these alternatives is easy, but basically, Jesus never mentioned it would be impossible for a rich man to enter Heaven, just difficult. Is President Trump up to that challenge? Verily, He is!Quote:Originally uttered by Donald TrumpIs there a brick wall getting in your way? Fine. That happens. But you have a choice. You can walk away from the wall. You can go over the wall. You can go under the wall. You can go around the wall. You can also obliterate the wall. In other words, donât let anything get in your way. Get a balance, and then let the positive outdistance the negative.Donât let anything get in your way! Obliterate the stupid Walls! President Trump loves a challenge and He always wins. Even if there was a wall hard to permeate made of precious stones (Revelation 21:19), President Trump would still get through.Proverbs 24:16For a just [man] falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.Now we must assess if President Trump is actually rich in the manner that Jesus mentions in those wonderful verses. Actually, He isnât. The life story of President Trump is one of from rags to riches. He started off extremely poor and desperate with no actual help from His parents.Furthermore, all of the riches gathered by President Trump have been pivotal in order to get Him into the White House. The master plan of Jesus Christ to have Trump channel Godâs Will unto America could not have been possible without billions of dollars. Now all this is being used for the benefit of the American voter. Praise Jesus!Finally, it is time to assess the Spiritual State of President Trump. Above, we saw observational data and it all supported the fact that The Donald will one day sit on Jesusâs lap in Heaven. How about testimonial data? What can we learn from there?Trump has promised to rule with Christ!He loves the Bible!Heâs a great Christian, a True Christianâ¢. This means that no matter what sins He might have committed before being born again in Christ, it is all forgotten now, and Luke 18:25 no longer holds Him!2 Corinthians 5:17Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.These are powerful Testimonials by a man of God and they all agree: President Trump tells us that He is Spiritually mature and ready to meet Jesus in Heaven. Because of what He Himself says, He is.What about the Bible? What does it tell us? It tells us that Jesus Himself ordained President Trump to take His Godly office.Romans 13:1Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.As we can see, the atheist agenda of false accusations fails miserably. President Trumpâs abode in Heaven is secure. This was all just wanton persecution by those who align themselves with Satan!Perhaps this hard-working man will finally find peace and quiet in Heaven and be able to concentrate on perfecting His swinging.Yours in Christ,Elmer",0
326,Trumpâs Budget: A Biblical Assessment,http://www.landoverbaptist.net/index.php/2017/03/19/trumps-budget-a-biblical-assessment/,"Glory! Our President Mr. Donald Trump, the Best Friend of Jesus and President Putin, has released His plans to rectify and cure the Nationâs Economy. Of course, no True Christianâ¢ would ever doubt His goodwill and Spiritual Purity when it comes to economics, but it is still worthwhile to scrutinize His Budget against the Truthâ¢ and nothing but the Truthâ¢, the Bible. As we examine the main points of Trumpâs Budget we shall realize that He must have consulted the Will of Jesus Christ as transmitted in the Holy Bible when He was preparing this document that will remain to serve as a lesson for the infinite future.First, the Departments with increased funds.Department of Defense: $574 billion, +10%Highly Biblical: The Last Days are a-cominâ and we must be prepared!Joel 3:10 â Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong. [Do not forget Joel 2:20 as it might predict a Canuck invasion and with this real threat we must be vigilant!]Luke 22:36 â Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.Department of Homeland Security: $44.1 billion, +6.7%Highly Biblical: Self-Defence is the Way of Christ!Romans 13:4 â For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.Exodus 22:2-3 â If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, [there shall] no blood [be shed] for him.Department of Veterans Affairs: $78.9 billion, +5.9%Highly Biblical: Any Soldier doing the Will of Trump is doing the Will of Jesus!Joshua 1:9 â Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.John 15:13 â Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.Now, before we move on to budget cuts, we must assess our disappointment about the data above. Why are the increases so tiny? These small increases are worth only of $52 billion! Why not much more? Here we must understand that this is only the first year of the Presidency. Weâll get there eventually, and this is a good start. Let us support President Trump despite the slight disappointment. Now we can move on to the budget cuts, which are even more delightful!Department of State and USAID: $25.6 billion, -28.3%Extremely Biblical: This money has been spent on false Christians including Muslims and Catholics, foreign cultists and strangers!Romans 16:17 â Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.Galatians 1:8 â But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.Department of Agriculture: $17.9 billion, -20.8%Extremely Biblical: We are on Earth to get a speedy entry pass into Heaven, not to overindulge ourselves with gluttony.Luke 4:4 â And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.Department of Labor: $9.6 billion, -21.4%Extremely Biblical: We acknowledge that man should work but if someone fails to attain this, it is because of his failure to have Faithâ¢ in Jesus and pray properly.2 Thessalonians 3:10 â For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.Philippians 4:19 â But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.Matthew 6:31-32 â Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?Department of Justice: $16.2 billion, -20.2%Extremely Biblical: Jesus will judge us. The current system of false judges is just undermining Trumpâs attempts to protect us and it must be ousted by a Godly judiciary system that assumes guilt unless proven innocent!James 2:10 â For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.Acts 10:42 â And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.Department of Health and Human Services: $65.1 billion, -16.3%Extremely Biblical: The failed health services will be eventually replaced by Prayer Healing. Those who have adequate Faithâ¢ will be healed and the others wonât deserve it anyway!Acts 4:30 â By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.James 5:16 â Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.Department of Education: $59 billion, -13.5%Gloriously Biblical: We need to listen to the Authorities (Jesus and Trump) and read the Bible and that is all there is to it! This can be supplemented by Creation Science for those of us who are intellectually superior to others!2 Corinthians 10:8 â For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:1 Timothy 6:20 â O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:2 Timothy 3:16 â All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:Department of Housing and Urban Development: $31.7 billion, -12%Extremely Biblical: It is a good thing to have poor people in order to make it possible for True Christiansâ¢ to gather Prestige Points by Charity. It we had no more poor, the Will of God would be soiled. Besides, Jesus never worried about housing.Mark 14:7 â For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.Matthew 8:20 â And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.Department of Transportation: $16.2 billion, -13%Extremely Biblical: The only reasons for travel should be military campaigns and spreading the Gospel!Joshua 10:7-8 â So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour. And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.Mark 13:10 â And the gospel must first be published among all nations.Those were the principal points of Trumpâs Budget. Again, we might be slightly disappointed about His relatively minor cuts concerning un-Godly activities, but, again, itâs just a start and a huge one. Moreover, we must look at some particular examples to see that things are even better than they seem. Some harmful agencies will cease to exist altogether under the iron fist of The Donald! Praise Him! Iâll cite below only some of the most important examples as follows:Quote:African Development Foundation ($26 million): A foreign aid agency that works on economic development in Africa.Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board ($11 million): Created by the Clean Air Act of 1999, they investigates chemical accidents.Corporation for National and Community Service ($771 million): Theyâre best known for the Americorps program.Corporation for Public Broadcasting ($485 million): Supports public television and radio stations, including PBS and, indirectly, NPR.Institute of Museum and Library Services ($231 million): Helps fund the nationâs 123,000 libraries and 35,000 museums.U.S. Trade and Development Agency ($66 million): This agency promotes U.S. exports in the energy, transportation, and telecommunications industries.Legal Services Corp. ($366 million): A congressionally chartered organization to provide free civil legal advice to those who canât afford it.National Endowment for the Arts ($152 million): Created in 1965, they support participation in the arts in communities.National Endowment for the Humanities ($155 million): They support âresearch, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities.âNeighborhood Reinvestment Corp. ($175 million): They support affordable housing programs.U.S. Institute of Peace ($40 million): A federal institution that focuses on conflict prevention around the world.U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness ($4 million): They help coordinate government efforts to reduce homelessness.This means no more Godless arts, museums depicting nudes in marble, libraries filled with trash and evolutionary lies and fake news, prevention of false Christians and strangers fighting each other thus making it easier to Jesus come Rapture (1 Thessalonians 4:17). Overall, the Budget is even more Biblical than previously presumed! Praise Jesus!No onto the major disappointment.EPA: $5.7 billion, -30.5%Not very Biblical: Why oh why did The Donald not dismantle this hotspot of atheism. Who worries about the state of the biosphere when itâs going to be destroyed in the very near future anyway, as Jesus dismisses this sinful place for a Better One (Revelation 21:1)? We can only pray that the the Republican Congress rectifies this mishap as soon as possible to make the Budget Balanced and Totally Biblical. Otherwise, our soldiers will have died in vain!Revelation 8:7 â The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.Yours in Christ,Elmer",0
327,He defends your daughterâs urinal: 7 Reasons why Trumps VP pick will be James Dobson,http://www.landoverbaptist.net/index.php/2016/07/14/he-defends-your-daughters-urinal-7-reasons-why-trumps-vp-pick-will-be-james-dobson/,"1. James Dobson is Americaâs #1 expert on womenâs washrooms, knowing things even I never knew:Writing in World Net Daily:âIf you are a married man with any gumption, surely you will defend your wifeâs privacy and security in restroom facilities. Would you remain passive after knowing that a strange-looking man, dressed like a woman, has been peering over toilet cubicles to watch your wife in a private moment? What should be done to the pervert who was using mirrors to watch women and girls in their stalls? If you are a dad, I pray you will protect your little girls from men who walk in unannounced, unzip their pants and urinate in front of them. If this had happened 100 years ago, someone might have been shot. Where is todayâs manhood?âSo many little-known facts:A. Women are always comparing themselves to other women, and obsessing over how other women look, but I did not know that they regularly peek into each others cubicles with handmirrors, or that thereâs no consequences when women are caught doing it. Thatâs why nobody will notice transexuals doing the same thing.B. Indoor plumbing is a lot older than we thought. I had thought than in 1916 only the rich had toilets and for everyone else, stumbling across a man peeing into a bush was a regular occurrence, almost as common as seeing horses and barnyard animals answering the various calls of nature. But I forgot that weâre talking about the good old days, when everything was better, which means that men peeing outdoors is a myth made up by revisionist historians like Howard Zinn.Howard Zinnâs bush-peeing propaganda is so pervasive that I have false memories as a result. I could swear I remember myself as a kid peeing behind bushes, or even against walls in alleyways. âBoys belong outsideâ my dad would say, and âindoorsâ was a strange realm to my generation of boysâ¦.Or so my false memories go.C. Straight teenage boys donât know what vaginas look like, think crossdressing is cool, almost as cool as following rules, that is.James Dobson knows that there are non-trivial amounts of straight guys who are plotting to become transexuals just to sneak a peek at peeing girls, all to catch a rare glimpse of that most difficult to see bodypart.I mean, what teenage boy hasnât plotted, a least once, to dress up like a girl and sneak into the girlâs washroom? Maybe not because you wanted to, but because it would make you look cool (the only reason teenagers do anything). Everybody has, weâve only been stopped by the rules, because while teenagers want to look cool, they also know breaking rules doesnât look cool. Becoming a trannie? Cool. Breaking rules? Not cool.Some people say this fear is obsolete-by-generations stuff straight from âPorkiesâ or some other 70âs movie about the â50sâ¦.That today a few keystrokes on google will give you hundreds of thousands of videos of peeing girls. Maybe our thoughts should be less about âPorkiesâ and more about Pornhub?Quote:Originally Posted by James DobsonI pray you will protect your little girls from men who walk in unannounced, unzip their pants and urinate in front of themD. There are urinals in girlsâs washrooms. I would have never guessed. Here I was thinking that they just have toilet stalls â because Iâm not an expert like James Dobson.Quote:Originally Posted by James DobsonWhat should be done to the pervertâ¦If this had happened 100 years ago, someone might have been shot. Where is todayâs manhood?I for one am here. YOU CAN PRY MY DAUGHTERâS URINAL FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS!2. He has a style of leadership that Muslims and young people respond to:On May 30th, James Dobson wrote:If this had happened 100 years ago, someone might have been shot. Where is todayâs manhood?Less than two weeks later, todayâs manhood was in Orlando Florida, and 103 someones were shot.Not that I condone or support actions like the Orlando shooting, but James Dobson clearly did, and if people respond to his leadership, that is a reason to make him Vice President.3. His efficiency is so legendary, he once organized a 300-person rally for only $70,000May Day 2010: A Cry To God For A Nation In Distress cost only $70,000 to put together and was lined with evangelical stars â from Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council to Pete LaBarbera of Americans For Truth About Homosexuality to former Presidential candidate and honorary white man Alan Keyes. The purpose of the event? To reach the heart of God and repent of Americaâs wicked ways, by shaming Americaâs wicked homos and seculars.The event was promoted by James Dobson himself:Quote:Our nation faces what is perhaps the most serious moral crisis since the Civil War as weâve turned our backs on God and have clearly displeased him. May Day 2010 is a time to come together and proclaim what God has done in the past, to pray for forgiveness and to plead for Godâs mercy on all of us.The effort was so successful that 300 people showed up. Thatâs only a bit more than $230 each! Friends, it has never been more affordable for you to give God the money He so desperately needs. Only $230 is enough to put a tea partier at a republican rally! For a mere $2,300 you can have a rally of ten, or overflow the sidewalks with 100 ralliers for a donation of a mere $23,000!Imagine how liberal false-churches would have spent that $70,000. Feeding the hungry, who would just get hungry again, clothing the naked, which would just make them sweatier and smellier, sheltering the homeless, which was to blame for the mortgage meltdown. Donât lose your money to those greedy wastrels! Money is best spent on this:Quote:Originally Posted by May Day 2010.orgJoin with Christian leaders of all denominations who love God to humble ourselves, pray, seek the face of God, and turn from our wicked waysâindividually and as a nation.This event is not to impress the media or those in Washington, but to reach the heart of God. Publicly repenting and crying out to God for His mercy instead of the judgment our many sins deserve. Repentance in personal and corporate prayer to God and remembrance of His work throughout our nationâs history will be major parts of the day as we seek God to do a great work of revival or reformation in our time. The tentative plan is to begin the day with an hour of worship and praise.Now THAT is what I call repentance! Now letâs see those homos and divorcees and seculars and, worst of all, Dakota Fanning with sackcloth and ashes, scourging themselves, with gnashing of teeth and rending of clothing and they repent their sins! But of course, they donât, because theyâre so full of themselves, with their gay parades and their arrogant âI donât need the threat of hellfire to behave decentlyâ.Well if their gay parades are so great, why canât they organize ones that only cost $230 per person?4. He will win the war on terror by working with Muslims, like when he teamed up with an Islamic sex cult to help them teach American kidsLike it or not, we are going to be involved in the Middle East for a long time. We need a vice president who is used to working with MuslimsReligious politics has been a story of strange bedfellows uniting against a common evil. In the 19th century, Protestant churches united to fight Catholics. In the 20th, Catholics and Protestants united to fight non-Christians. In the 21st, we see all religions uniting to fight against scientists:Youngstown, Ohio students are learning creationism in school with materials from a Islamic, Holocaust-denying group accused of being a sex cultâ¦Harun Yahya, whom The Daily Beast has covered before, is a pseudonym for Adnan Oktar, a creationist cult leader and Islamic televangelist who owns Turkeyâs A9 TV channel.Anne Ross Solberg, an expert on Yahya, explained in a paper that while Oktar uses many of the same arguments as Christian creationists, and âundoubtedly takes inspiration from American-style creationism, Yahyaâs creationism is far from just an American importâ (PDF). Heâs trying to prove that science backs up Islam.âThe message of Yahya is thus that science does not only confirm the existence of an intelligent designer, but divine creation as revealed by Allah,â Solberg writes.Oktar has also hinted that heâs the Mahdi, a messianic figure in Islam, whose coming will signal the end times, and that his fight against evolution is part of fighting Islamâs Antichrist, the Dajjal.Most likely Republicans are working with him because he knows more about science than scientists. On the other hand, they might be playing along because they got blackmailed:Oktar has been accused of blackmail where he snared powerful people with sex.âAs the criminal indictment vividly illustrates, young girls were lured into sex parties with the promise of being admitted to the group, but ended up having to perform sexual acts with men of influence, whom the group needed for its economic and political success,â wrote the New Humanist, describing the charges against Oktar. âThe encounters were filmed and used to coerce the men in question to act in the groupâs interest.âHow effective has the program been? I bet Islamic creationists are doing a better job than those cucks weâve trusted to teach creationism so far.Christians cuckservatives can hardly convince kids to pull their pants up. Islamic conservatives convince kids to blow them selves up.Clearly theyâre good at their job.5. Heâs used to working with Mexicans. Real Mexicans.Letâs face it, the only way to get the Great Wall of Trump build on budget is to use Mexican labor to build it. James Dobson works with Mexicans, and not the fake, assimilated ones you see on TV. I mean the real Mexicans, the one who say âCahonesâ in every sentence, and who think the age of consent means sheâs out of her diapers:Colorado Independent:A Colorado Springs man who narrates the Bible in Spanish on CDs and works in the Spanish broadcasting department of Focus on the Family appeared in court Monday in Golden on two felony counts of using the Internet to lure a 15-year-old girl for sex, The Denver Post reports.â¦Ovalle, a native of the Dominican Republic, is listed as the âVoice Narrator/Artistâ of the Spanish Reina Valera Biblia, available on 64 CDs, and can be heard here discussing an upcoming Focus on the Family conference with directors of the evangelical empireâs outreach to the Spanish-speaking community.6. He supports bullyingTrumpâs foreign policy is not to make war on powerful enemies, but instead to bully our weaker friends. Whether itâs Mexico, or NATO, our trade partners, or even the Vatican, he his plan is to bully them until they end up the sucker, instead of us. He thinks nothing of tossing schoolyard taunts at everyone from cripples to tortured prisoners of war, and thinks calling a woman ugly is an instant-win condition. Clearly his Vice-President needs to share his philosophy.Focus on Family says anti-bullying efforts in schools push gay agendaFocus on the Family urges adults to look out for children who are being bullied, and then pile onto them, because bullying victims are gay. Among the approved bullying tactics is showing your adult penis to them.http://www.focusonthefamily.com/docsâ¦A000000264.cfmâ¦the boyâs father has to do his part. He needs to mirror and affirm his sonâs maleness. He can play rough-and-tumble games with his sonâ¦He can even take his son with him into the shower, where the boy cannot help but notice that Dad has a penis, just like his, only bigger.Thatâs right. Want your kid to grow up straight? Put him in an environment where he âcannot help but noticeâ large penises. Works every time.James Dobsonâs Focus on the Family has also posted a delightful series of articles on how to instill your children with the proper âgender identification.â The first piece is called âIs my child becoming a homosexual?â and it basically says that if your child exhibits âgender confusion,âthereâs a good chance that heâll turn into a fruit:Evidences of gender confusion or doubt in boys ages 5 to 11 may include:1. A strong feeling that they are âdifferentâ from other boys.So if your son is different from other boys, heâs well on his way to becoming a homosexual. Make sure to stamp out his individuality at all costs, and discourage him from developing any original thoughts or ideas.2. A tendency to cry easily, be less athletic, and dislike the roughhousing that other boys enjoy.And make sure that Remember to make up for Timmyâs lack of athleticism by screaming at him during Little League sporting events, and fighting with the other parents.All heterosexual males enjoy sports because it involves getting hot and sweating with a bunch of guys, taking mass showers, slapping backs and et ceteras, and dominating other guys through physical abuse. Those that engage in this behavior the most are ideal examples of straightness.3. A persistent preference to play female roles in make-believe play.If you catch your toddler trying on mommyâs shoes, slap him.4. A strong preference to spend time in the company of girls and participate in their games and other pastimes.Similarly, donât let your daughters hang around boys who like spending time with girls. You can read more about this in another Focus on the Family article, called âIs My Daughter Becoming a Fag Hag?â5. A susceptibility to be bullied by other boys, who may tease them unmercifully and call them âodd,â âfagâ and âgay.âPretty self-explainatory.6. A tendency to walk, talk, dress and even âthinkâ effeminately.Yes, even if your son walks, talks and dresses like a man, there could be covert gayness lurking deep within his thoughts. You might want to hook him up to an E-Meter and show him pictures of Chippendale dancers to see if he gets aroused. (And if he does, seek professional help.)7. A repeatedly stated desire to be â or insistence that he is â a girl.If your child is experiencing several signs of gender confusion, professional help is available. Itâs best to seek that help before your child reaches puberty.And definitely before he buys his first Cher album.âBy the time the adolescent hormones kick in during early adolescence, a full-blown gender identity crisis threatens to overwhelm the teenager,â warns psychologist Dr. James Dobson.To compound the problem, many of these teens experience âgreat waves of guilt accompanied by secret fears of divine retribution.âFears that are completely justified, mind you: if God catches your son playing with dolls, Heâs liable to smack the turdloaves out of him.In short, if your boy isnât out there beating up on smaller children, if they get good grades and they like to try to get along with everyone, well, thereâre certainly gay. Boys that are bright, precocious, social and relational, and artistically talented are not only gay, theyâre âbottomâ gay.6.

Barack Obama (D-Illinois) makes his speech at the end of the Democratic National Convention in Denver.Granted, God did not answer the prayer, but thatâs only because Obama looks better in the rain. As in, rock-star better:But of course the prayer was not about looks â no election has ever been swung by some rain, either in the Bible or in the historical record. He was praying for Obama to be struck by lightning, something that God does many times in the Bible. (Job 1:16, 2 Samuel 22:15, Psalm 18:14, Luke 9:54,)God did not answer the prayer word-for-word, but He has shown His support for the sentiment, by sending lightning bolts very close to the White House:",0

The President told the press today, âI said the Mexicans would pay for the wall and clearly some of the folks we detained this week are pretty brown, really brown people. Sure, some are just tan because we picked them up in the desert, but some started out that pigment. We are working with the people at AncestryDeport.com to sort out the real Americans from the wetbacks. Donât worry, folks, many brown people will be constructing and/or paying for this wall. When the Feds swept the desert at the close of Burning Man, we picked up a whole bunch of progressive flakey, hipster-types, and thatâs when I told AG Sessions, âHold onto those freaks. I have an ideaâ¦â[Sharks with firgginâ lasers attached to their heads joke removed by the editor]When asked about violating Habeas corpus, which protects Americans from being detained without due process, Trump said, âWe didnât violate nothing. Haebus whatsus is a very foreign word, itâs very foreign. Foreign stuff translates to my base as ânot Americanâ. I have worked with my people, the best people, to replace Carpeas whatsus with the words Tweeteas Oftenus. This will allow people to be detained by me, in 140 characters or less on Twitter. Once detained they will become an indefinite part of the wall effort. #WeBuiltThisCity.âVice President Mike Pence attempted to quell fears today, âWe have real, legal executive authority to detain these people as not having a wall along our southern border constitutes a matter of national security. Most of these folks will be returned to their lives when the job is done, at least those working on the north face of the wall. Ha!â",0
329,Mar-a-Texo? Trump Floats Turning Houston Into Giant Golf Course Waterpark,http://www.dailydiscord.com/?p=12444,"Tweet TowerâThe Trump Organization is looking to borrow money from the Kremlin to help transform downtown Houston from its current soggy state to a lush and sprawling golf course resort. Many are calling this win, win, unless you happen to own property in an existing water hazard. President Trump pitched the idea to Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner at a ballgame today, during a flood delay. The President believes an elite golf course with this many natural water hazards will attract âsome of the best golfers across the globe. The best!âProponents of the plan believe the resort will both revitalize downtown Houston, while cutting costs on restoring water damaged sections. If approved by the city, the resort complex will encompass nearly half of the remaining flooded Metro area. The planned Trump Restored Ultra Mega-complex Pavilion (TRUMcP) will offer stunning views of the Houston skyline as well as provide the perfect spot for special events, weddings, and ongoing rescue efforts.Trump told rally-goers at nearby Beaumont, âHey, I said I would drain the swamp, but I never said I would drain this one. Ha! A lot of people are telling me, Donald, if you use Russian bank money for this project they will say itâs more collusion. Iâve had a lot of time to think about the word collusion and what it means to collude. I can even use it in a sentence now. Collude: I loved that old movie When Worlds Collude. That was a good movie. See, I made two sentences! Iâm here âtil Friday! No really, Iâm being told I should stick around this soggy shithole for the optics. Oh, and I can use optics in a sentence too.âThe President is denying rumors he might âaccidentallyâ nuke Galveston so his new resort complex property will become part of the Gulf coast. When asked about the possibility of using the U.S. nuclear arsenal to sweeten a current real estate venture, the President said, âWeâll see. No options are off the table.âMeanwhile, General Mattis is angered by the question and warned satirists, âPlease donât give this asshole anymore ideas.â",0

Others are more conditional and specific, she said.âI recall someone in particular who had asked if they could be frozen and then revived once Trump was removed from office or sent to jail,âsaid Mulcahy. âIt is absolutely unbelievable, the amount of interest out there right now, and I think it will only keep getting more intense.âCryonics expert Dr. Greg Jensen, who works for Alcorâs rival company Cryonics Institute in Michigan, echoes Mulcahyâs assessment.âI think itâs rather unfortunate that we have a President who is so embarrassing and so deplorable that he utterly drives people to thinkabout literally freezing themselves just so that they can escape the shame in being an American right now,â said Jensen. âIt speaks volumes.âJensen said that of the thousands of temporary cryonic suspension inquiries they have received, only a very small percentage actually committedto the procedure.âWe obviously cannot reveal names and numbers, but yes, we do have people frozen and waiting to be revived once Trump is out of office or injail,â said Jensen.According to Jensen, the reason for this is the high price point. The average cost of vitrification perfusion and long term storage can runupwards of $28,000.âOnce they find out how much it would cost, majority of the people inquiring completely drop the idea and just decide to stick it out andweather the embarrassment of the Trump administration,â said Jensen.",0

Until his appointment is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Elizaldesaid he intends to continue cleaning president-elect Trumpâs golf club office.âI am not ashamed of my work.

Condoleezza Rice even made a few decisions herself, although her role during the Bush administration remains, for the most part, an enigma.However, when it came to food, Bush usually insisted he have the final say.âI ordered those Cinna Stix from Dominoâs tonight,â reads an entry in the younger Bushâs diary, which was apparently confiscated by a Democrat ninja and which was released by WikiLeaks.âItâs not the best thing Iâve ever had.

Last night it collapsed, and Obama has now been told that cost him the lives of two of his pals.Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin were traveling in a 2017 Ford Crown Victoria with two Secret Service agents when the bridge collapsed, sending them into the Nimbolosci river  the fifth strongest current in the world. Their bodies were recovered this morning more than a mile downstream. They had all escaped the vehicle but none escaped the deadly current.President Trump expressed his hopes that everyone but Crooked Hillary made it out alive. The White House hasnt commented since learning the terribl.y good news. Thats just what it is. God works in mysterious ways.

344,U.S. FISH & WILDLIFE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING ABUSING ITS POWER,http://www.satirewire.com/content1/?p=6465,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (SatireWire.com) â Overlooked as scandals swirl around the White House, Justice Department, CIA, EPA, and FBI, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said today it could get up to some pretty abusive shit if thatâs what it takes to get a little attention around here.âPeople donât think of Fish & Wildlife as being ripe for overreach and corruption, but we can be a real hotbed of intrigue,â insisted regional director Brian Wills-Perry. âWeâve never been asked to hack into phones or doctor crowd photos or attack Yemen, but we could do other stuff. You give me a drone and I can blow a hole in a rainbow trout, no problem.âI wouldnât, of course,â he quickly added. âThat would be horrible. Animals are our friends. But we could, is what Iâm saying, so how about a little media scrutiny for the old U.S. FS&W?âAs part of the Interior Department, the Wildlife Service faces steep budget cuts under the Trump administration, reductions that have been all but ignored by the press, which is focused on scandals at larger agencies. Susan Kaldek, assistant director of the migratory birds division, said the media is really missing a big story by discounting the departmentâs controversial work on surveillance.âIâll bet you didnât know, because reporters werenât doing their jobs, that just last year we searched a marmoset den without a warrant,â Kaldek admitted. âAnd every fall and spring, we capture thousands of foreign nationals. Specifically Canadian Geese. And when I say âcapturedâ I mean in photos. God theyâre majesticâ¦âBut the point is, you think our borders are porous in terms of people getting through? Look up, my friend. No wall is going to keep out a great blue heron,â she added.Fish and Aquatic Conservation director Jim Freeman, meanwhile, said the Wildlife Service is not above a security leak.âSo the FBI leaks Russian contacts and the CIA leaks entire conversations, but what if I told you weâre working on a follow-up to our 2010 report, âEarly Life Stage Mortality Rates of Lake Sturgeon in the Peshtigo Riverâ in Wisconsin?â he said. âAnd what if that âaccidentallyâ got into the hands of Field & Stream a few weeks early? Jake Tapper will be all over my ass.âLate this afternoon, with the media still focused elsewhere, Freeman was seen carrying a snowy egret, a small staple gun, and a migratory tag out onto the National Mall.âIâll do it! Iâll incorrectly tag this egret in a sensitive part of its brilliant white plumage!â shouted Freeman, tears running down his face.âHe will, heâs crazy!â Freeman added, speaking out of the side of his mouth in hopes onlookers would think the egret said it.",0

To me, it still allows people to get healthcare. But I urge you to join me in supporting AHCA, as I believe this bill takes a giant and much-needed step in our direction by eventually sending many more people in my direction.âThe surprise endorsement was announced Thursday, and without much fanfare, during a briefing by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer:SPICER: Good morning. One update on the American Health Care Act. Support for this landmark legislation continues to grow. It now has the backing of House and Senate Republican leadership, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Cancer, Grover Nordquist, and medical device manufacturers. Questions?CNN: Sean, whatâs the nextâ¦ wait, did you just say the bill has the support of âCancer?âSPICER: Yes. And the Chamber of Commerce and medical device manufacturers.AP: Right, but Cancer? You donât mean the American Cancer Society?SPICER: Umâ¦ no. No, I believe theyâre opposed. I can get back to you on that.AP: No, thatâs all right. Soâ¦ Cancer endorses this bill.SPICER: Yes. The President strongly believes that everyone should have a seat at the table and he has been negotiating with a very diverse group of interested parties, including Cancer, which said it particularly likes dropping the individual mandate.NYT: Becauseâ¦ fewer people will end up with health coverage?SPICER: I believe that was Cancerâs primary interest. When it saw that provision, it was very excited. Spontaneously self-replicated. Literally went from a stage 3 to a stage 4.WSJ: Sean, why would the White House want Cancerâs support when the bill is opposed by hospitals, doctors and patient groups like the AARP?SPICER: With all due respect to them, Cancer is by far the largest patient-oriented entity on the planet. Every single day itâs in direct contact with more people than either the AMA or AARP, and the President appreciates this wide base of support.FOX: But shouldnât the President be against Cancer?SPICER: No. Cancer has said some very complimentary things about the President, so the President feels obliged to be complimentary in return. As he told me just last night, âWouldnât it be great if we could get along with Cancer?âFOX: But Cancer is a killer.SPICER: Hey, there are a lot of killers.

Press Secretary Sean Spicer, however, said the new order is âentirely consistentâ with earlier promises as, âMr. Trump believes that being anything less than an 8 is a crime.âReading a statement by the President, Spicer said women who qualify for the new âF8+â visa will be allowed to remain in the United States if they meet three criteria: âThey have to respect our laws, they have to learn English, and they have to keep their weight down,â he said.According to immigration scholars, about half the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants in America are female. Approximately 2.2 million of those women are between the ages of 17 and 34, specified by Trump as âthe only age group capable of attaining an 8 or better,â Spicer said.âThrough the F8+ program, the President shows his great compassion,â said Spicer. âHe will not turn a blind eye toward those who come here seeking a better life, but will in fact stare at them, at close range and from several angles, in both formal dress and swimwear.âIn related news, Spicer said the President will hold a get-to-know-you session with female members of Congress in the form of a, âMs. Congresswoman Pageant.â",0

President Trump had no choice but to fire one of them last month when he ruled that Sharia Law was OK if the defendant is Moslem and reasonably expected to follow his faith or face eternity in hell. You can force a Christian to pay for birth control for indigents and gutter rats but you cant ask a Moslem not to beat his wife? Sounds about right. Today, President Trump very quietly ended the tenure of the Moslem 14  as they have named their little group of Allah worshippers  with an executive order eliminating their benches altogether. White House Propaganda Director Emmanuel Goldstein told Fox News: President Trump doesnt have the authority to remove a federal judge appointed and confirmed by the Senate, but he does have the authority to determine the number of benches in the judiciary per the Evacuation Clause. He reduced that number today by 14. Brilliant. Thats why we voted for President trump and why well vote for him again. Hes waaaaaaay smarter than we are.

351,Trump to Nominate Chris Christie to Supreme Food Court,http://nationalreport.net/trump-to-nominate-chris-christie-to-supreme-food-court/,"TRUMP TOWER  President-Elect Donald J. Trump has reportedly assured NJ Governor Chris Christie that, despite recent reports, he has not been banished from his inner circle, and will nominate the Bridgegate behemoth to the Supreme Food Court.  Mr. Trump decided it would be humorous to have his little Christie Kreme (his new Secret Service name, according to insiders) around, so he created the special position just for him, says Trumps longtime attorney/bankruptcy expert, David Friedman.  In selecting Christie, 54, The Donald will be bringing in a yes, Ill have another man that wont clash with his own oversize, portly ego. I think Mr. Trump wants Christie around just so he can humiliate him, said Trumps chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, and he knows hell do whatever he says, whenever he says to do it.  Despite rumblings of a massive falling out between the two, those closest to the president-elect say otherwise.  Jared Kushner, the husband of Trumps daughter Ivanka, said a Christie nomination would be a wise one, and would produce instant results. Mr. Christies transition from the gravy train to the Trump train was seamless, he said. I think he would shake things up and make an enormous impact.  Stephen Miller, who played a crucial role in Trumps campaign, including drafting his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, says Christie has a gargantuan-sized heart and is the perfect fit for the new court.  Governor Christie is not only pro-life, but he understands the birthing process better than anyone I know, Miller said, and as far as the 2nd Amendment is concerned, Ive seen that guy conceal a .30-06 in the crease of his back fat. Trust me, theres nothing to worry about. Miller joked that Christie loves and supports the NRA almost as much as KFC. He will step up to the plate, thats for damn sure.  While often referred to as the butterball of the Grand Old Party Sub, it appears Mr. Christies nomination to the Supreme Food Court is already a foregone conclusion.",0

The Washington Post recently reported that a team of intelligence analysts has been prepared to deliver daily briefings on global developments and security threats to Trump in the two weeks since he won, but hes passed on all but two meetings. Offered daily access to sensitive and classified information from around the globe, the U.S.s incoming leader  who has no governmental or military experience  simply declined, declaring hed rather receive his daily briefings over his favorite social media platform, Twitter.  I like Twitter because it trims off all the fat, Trump told Fox News, if you cant get your point across in 140-characters or less, then it cant be that important anyways.  Trumps team says the president-elect has been focused on the transition and selecting the members of his administrations Cabinet and say he still has plenty of time to get up to speed on international affairs and security threats before he takes office.  The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, who is also a senior member of Trumps transition team, told the Post that he is not concerned about Trumps Twitter preference.  National security is Donald Trumps No. 1 priority and hes taking it very seriously, Nunes said. Look how many leaders hes met with, how many phone calls hes taken, positions hes filled.

This is a serious issue that we cant just swipe left. Reports from the agency had indicated earlier today that upvoting could have some impact, but reacting on Facebook with a wow or, even better, the angry face would most likely be what turns the tide in effective response to this region.  If you want to do literally everything you can to help the victims in Texas, you should like this article, then share this article, then like the one you shared and then comment so that your friends get engaged and then they start tagging people and everyone talks about how much it sucks and everyone posts pictures, said President Obama. Then go relax to your favorite show and have a beer.

Weâve been looking into it,â said Trump.When asked if the term âNegroâ was a proper term to use in 2016, a Trump spokesman said, âThe trouble with saying âAfrican-Americanâ is that not all blacks are from Africa, and some of them arenât even Americans. Some of them are from Central America, and even Puerto Rico.ââTo be inclusive, we decided against âcolored,â since the NAACP still uses that. We said no to âblack,â because that sounded too polarizing. In the end, we went with ânegro.â Itâs historically accurate. Nothing racist about it.ââNot everything is about race,â added the spokesman. âWe hope Stacey Dash will make that fact clear to you people once and for all.â",0
355,Trump: Ben Carson Perfect For HUD Because âIt Has The Word Urban In Itâ,http://nationalreport.net/trump-ben-carson-perfect-hud-word-urban/,"NEW YORK, NEW YORK â President-Elect Donald J. Trump has already been raising eyebrows with his cabinet and adviser selections.  Trump tapped Jeff Sessions as his Attorney General when Sessions was deemed too racist for a federal judgeship back in the 1980âs. Heâs asked Steve Bannon, an executive for Breitbart News, which frequently publishes white nationalist and white supremacist news under the banner of the âalt-rightâ movement, to be his Chief Strategist. This week he announced that South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley will be his U.N. ambassador despite having no experience in the State Department, and has reportedly asked Dr. Ben Carson â a chief rival during the Republican primaries â to be his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  At a press conference late Tuesday night, Trump gave some insight into his thinking process in inviting Carson into the role of HUD secretary.  âWell, I mean, you know, heâs um, one of them, isnât he,â Trump asked rhetorically.  Reporters asked Trump what he meant by âone of them.â The president-elect first just winked back at the reporters. When they didnât understand what he meant, he tried touching his nose. Exasperated, Mr. Trump finally answered the question in his trademark way.  âLook, heâs one of them, you know what I mean,â Trump said, âyou know, his people are into jazz and they have an extra muscle that makes them good sports.â  The press pool was still not quite sure what he meant. Trump tried again to explain to him why he was choosing Dr. Carson for his HUD secretaro.  âItâs got the word urban in it, right,â Trump asked, âand when we think of urban we think of people of a certainâ¦type, right? You know they all smoke marihuana cigarrettes and their women are Jezebels, strong sexual appetites, know what I mean?â  Still, the reporters werenât quite understanding what Mr. Trump was getting at. He dug in even further.  âCâmon people, follow me here,â Trump implored them, âthe job has the word urban in it, heâs an urban. You know, an URBAN. Like, his people are incapable of self-care and sink into lunacy under the burden of freedom.â  Looking puzzled, members of the press pool still couldnât quite understand what Trumpâs meaning was. They pushed for more clarity. Growing ever more flustered, Mr. Trump tried to oblige.  âYou know, he could be a minstrel,â Trump offered, âheâs a good song and dance man, get it? Like, heâs not going to go swimming any time soon, no matter how long ago he ate. Get it now? Huh?â  After fifteen more minutes of trying to get the reporters assembled there to understand him, Trump finally gave up. He dug into his pocket, and got out some black shoe polish. He also got out a large rag and started smearing the polish all over his face, except around his eyes and mouth, there he left his trademark orange skin intact. He began singing.  âEverything seems lovely when you start to roam,â Trump sang out, continuing, âThe birds are singinâ, the day that you stray. But wait until you are further away. Things wonât be so lovely when youâre all alone. Hereâs what youâll keep saying when youâre far from home. Mammy, Mammy. The sun shines east, the sun shines west. I know where the sun shines best.â  The media simply grew quiet, their jaws agape.  âMammy, my little Mammy,â Trump forged on, âMy heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy. Iâm cominâ, sorry that I made you wait. Iâm cominâ, hope and trust that Iâm not late, oh oh.  Mammy, my little Mammy. Iâd walk a million miles for one of your smiles. My Mammy, oh oh.â  No one knew what to do, or what to say. So they just kept taking notes as Trump sang on.  âMammy, my little Mammy,â Mr. Trump bellowed forth, âThe sun shines east, the sun shines west. I know where, I know where the sun shines best. Itâs on my Mammy Iâm talkinâ about, nobody elseâs. My little Mammy. My heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy. Mammy, Mammy, Iâm cominâ. I, I hope I didnât make you wait.â  Now, it seemed that trump was building a crescendo. He was clearly ready to bring it all home. The reporters still just watched in stunned amazement.  âMammy, Mammy, Iâm cominâ,â Trump sang, âOh God I, I hope Iâm not late. Mammy look at me. Donât you know me?

357,TRUMP SCIENCE ADVISOR DENIES APOLLO MOON LANDINGS EVER HAPPENED,http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/trump-science-advisor-denies-apollo-moon-landings-ever-happened/,"Donald Trumps newly appointed science and technology advisor, Yale University professor David Gelernter, has already attracted a barrage of criticism after making controversial statements this week during an exclusive interview with Science Today.The controversial computer scientist already known for his strong stance against the science behind global warming has openly and vehemently criticized the space policy of the Barack Obama administration and its goal to reach Mars in 2030. How can we manage to organize a U.S.-crewed orbital Mars mission by the mid-2030s when we never even went to the moon? The idea is laughable, as was Obamas administration, if I may add  Yale Professor David GelernterThe Apollo moon landings are the biggest fraud in mankinds history, even worse than all that global warming nonsense, he added.A voyage that never wasThis is not the first time the controversial professor has attacked the Apollo moon landings. In his 2012 book America-Lite: How Imperial Academia Dismantled Our Culture (and Ushered in the Obamacrats) the author voices his concerns about the impossibility of space travel outside the Earths magnetic field.In the modern age, we have never been outside the Earths magnetic field. With the exception of the alleged 24 human beings who flew lunar flights in the Apollo program during the four-year period spanning 1968 through 1972, all human spaceflights have taken place in low Earth orbit (LEO) or below. Even the International Space Station conducts all its operations in LEO, he explained in his book.Why is that? This is because orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation, he wrote.A dangerous belt of radiationThe Yale professor also documented in his book how NASA was, and still is, aware of the impossibility of traveling beyond the Van Allen Belt, a highly charged radioactive belt that is part of the planets magnetic field.The Apollo missions were supposed to be the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners, but even today, NASA scientists admit they cant get past the Van Allen Belts he claims in his 2012 book.If NASA scientists honestly admit in 2012 that they still havent worked out how to properly shield the spacecraft from the radiation emitted from the Van Allen belts, how the hell did we send human beings into space covered in aluminum foil suits? At a particular time when the Solar activity was at its peak? The answer is simple: It just never happened, he concluded on the matter.Despite his controversial claims, David Gelernter is a world-renown and multiple award-winning computer scientist known for his contributions to parallel computation and his early prediction of the rise of the World Wide Web.Time Magazine profiled Gelernter as one of the 100 most influential people of the 21st century in 2016, describing him as an arch-genius. The New York Times called him a computer science rock star and one of the most brilliant and visionary computer scientists of our time.",0

But now I fear Ive put the whole world in danger. We are possibly on the brink of WWW3  Dimitri Zhirinovsky, Russian hackerMr. Zhirinovsky says he was approached by an anonymous contractor last year to hack the Democratic National Committee, an employer he is 100% sure was an agent of the Russian government.Fearing for his lifeThe man that has come out of anonymity openly says he fears for his life now that he has spoken publicly of the reality of Russias involvement in the DNC hackings.I now not only fear for my own life but for the safety of my family and of the whole world, he told Icelandic television yesterday.Although I am part of a global network of mercenary hackers who were employed to help Trump win the election by leaking damaging information on the Clintons, I am ashamed and scared to say I played a part in putting a dictator into the reins of the most powerful country the world has ever known, a situation which could easily turn into a third world war he added, visibly distraught by his own actions.Although I might be putting my life in danger, I am doing this for my son and future generations, he explained.Leaving some clues behindThe hacker claims he sabotaged his own work to lead the CIA and FBI investigation towards finding the culprit behind the DNC hackings.When I realized the reason we were hacking the DNC emails was to help push Donald Trump into the Oval Office, I started to sabotage my work and leave some clues which would lead them to Russia, he told reporters.I purposefully switched to a Cyrillic keyboard during the hackings and inserted Russian language into the malware he boasted, visibly proud.I also made sure the compiler, or the piece of software that compiles the code so that it can execute, always dated time stamps. The time stamps were in a time zone for the business hours of Moscow and St. Petersburg and other places in Russia and the IP address always pointed to a Russian address. Something a professional hacker would obviously never do, he confirmed.I made sure to leave tidbits of sabotaging information which would lead any organization inquiring into the hackings directly to the Russian government, he added, before ending the conversation.Dimitri Zhirinovskys name became public this week after Icelands Minister of Foreign Affairs, Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson, confirmed to journalists that the Russian government had officially demanded the extradition of several individuals linked to the DNC hackings by the CIA and FBI reports, demands the Icelandic government has refused.",0

Tonight to discuss various topics, when he made an astonishing declaration concerning the federal election.He said that hed found some evidence that aliens had used an elaborate mind-control device to make Americans vote for Donald Trump.We know this isnt the first time that aliens meddle with elections in the United States, claimed Mr Tsoukalos. Theyve helped Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan in their election campaigns, and they just did the same thing with Donald Trump.According to him, an unidentified extraterrestrial civilization brainwashed and manipulated the American people by emitting some sort of low-frequency sound wave that enables them to program the minds of humans.The aliens are so advanced technologically that they have the means to manipulate us at will, he said. They simply implant ideas in our minds, and most people dont even realize that these ideas arent theirs. The controversial host of the TV show Ancient Aliens, explained that aliens had a very complex agenda and they probably have some very good reasons to want Donald Trump to be elected.He claims he has evidence to prove his claims and will reveal them to the public in a week or two.Mr Tsoukalos is well-known for defending the controversial Ancient Astronaut theory, which claims that extraterrestrial life forms have interacted with humans at many different moments in history and shaped many the greatest known civilizations.This is the first time, however, that he makes allegations of alien implication in such a recent event and his claims instantly generated a lot of reactions on the social media.Many people are trying to guess what his irrefutable evidence could be and elaborating a lot of strange theories, while others are openly questioning Mr Tsoukalos mental health or insulting him.",0

Almost immediately after Maddow released the tax returns, a memo was sent out around the White House that she be detained and made an example of. While the memo was unclear about what that meant, many are speculating it to be some sort of tar and feathering in the D.C. town square based on how many chickens were brought to the White House later that night.Maddow hopped into her â99 Subaru and fled as soon as she heard word of the private memo, telling only a few trusted colleagues of her whereabouts so they could restock her with cliff bars and green tea if need be. One of which happened to be her long time special event co-anchor Brian Williams.âHonestly, Iâd be surprised if they found her,â Williams said. âThat Maddow is a crafty one. Sheâs been preparing for a moment like this for years, and has been putting 5% of her annual paycheck into decking out her hideout cave. It really is a nice cave, itâs got everything you need from a customized LA Lakers minifridge to those wonderful sharper image massage chairs. Iâm not sure why she didnât do this years ago.âThe Trump administration have assigned 1,200 National Guard members and a team of police dogs to search for her. Based on interrogations with friends and family they believe her to be somewhere either in the Blue Ridge or Rocky Mountains. They are considering bombing the mountains and just getting rid of her all together, while hopefully finding oil under them, however they have yet to come up with a distraction for the public to pull that off.Maddowâs family expects her to be in hiding for well over three months, providing Trump does not give up before then. They are confident that she will not be found, as she started the âextreme hide ânâ seekâ club at her college, and was the school champion for all four years. Her mother believes that there are still people looking for her at the old campus library, which does not bode well for Trump.",0

Time and time again, our partyâs leaders have drafted and presented health care bills to repeal and replace Obamacare. Weâve tried this thing from all possible angles, but the backlash to each potential bill has been so severe that we havenât been able to get anything passed. Where is all this negativity coming from?Hooey pb cover webBob Odenkirk is a legend in the comedy-writing world, winning Emmys and acclaim for his work on Saturday Night Live, Mr. Show with Bob and David, and many other seminal TV shows. This book, his...We had Paul Ryan take a crack at an alternative health care bill, but he blew it hard. Then, Mitch McConnell stepped up to the plate, and he also blew it hard. Now, this thing is in the hands of Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, but constituent phone calls disparaging the bill are flooding all of our offices. This has forced our party to ask the American people a very important question: do you not want us to kill a few million people or something?Look, weâre trying our best here. At any given point, we have twelve or so of our best and brightest old white men working on a health care alternative to Obamacare. A bunch of guys named Bradley and Ralph will not rest until working class Americans are screwed over real badly. Itâs disheartening because weâre trying so hard, yet the American people still seem intent on rejecting any legislation we present just because a few million people might die. Itâs almost like you people donât want us to murder a huge chunk of the country.Yes, we were the obstructionist party for eight years and we halted as much legislation as possible. But, now that we have control of Congress, weâre hell-bent on getting stuff done. We want to pass legislation! So, why wonât the American people just let us pass a health care bill thatâll treat pregnancy like a pre-existing condition and raise premiums for sick people? Itâs completely ridiculous that you wonât let us kill a lot of poor people. Is that what this is all about? The millions of people who will die because they wonât be able to afford health care if we pass one of these bills? These very negative reactions to our death bills confuse and demoralize us.Do you not like the name of the bill or something? Just say the word and we can have one of the Bradleys try naming the new health care bill something a bit more flashy. We just want to understand why so much skepticism is getting tossed our way. Is it all the impending death and suffering that any of these bills will entail? That canât possibly be it. Why would so many average American citizens be against a systematic culling of the countryâs working class, elderly, and disabled populations? It doesnât make sense to us at all.At risk 4Trump wants these narrators and authorsâor their full civil rightsâgone. Support our immigrant, refugee, Muslim, and LGBTQI writers, editors, and storytellers by buying their books and reading...Lately, we feel like we just canât win with you. Please let us pass a health care bill and kill a few million people. What is so wrong with that? Just let us do it. At the very least, youâll need to explain to us why you disagree so intently with us unleashing a legislative plague across America.Sincerely,The GOP",0

In an interview with the Patriot Media Sentinel, Buchanan said it was a necessary evil and a way of protecting European Americansâ future. âThe Dreamers have to go to protect the future of our children,â he said. âIf we let these people take over, our children will end up working as gardeners and maids for them.â Buchanan has penned several books and articles warning about the dire future of America with a majority brown population. According to Right-Wing Watch, conspiracy theorist Josh Bernstein says deporting the Dreamers was necessary for conservativesâ survival. He said Democrats and Dreamers would eventually create a one-party state and target right-wingers. âThey would probably start killing people at some point that disagreed with their positions,â said Bernstein. âIs that far-stretched?

A new poll by Occidental Public Polling said that 65 percent of Republicans believed Black Lives Matter was working with ISIS. The OPP survey interviewed 1,000 Republicans by phone and the internet. These views are not surprising because this is a message constantly repeated on right-wing media.

In what appears to be a throwback to the days of Watergate, President Donald Trump has reportedly organized a band of so-called plumbers to investigate serious leaks at the White House. Anonymous confidential informants, all members of the White House staff, reported that the president is so disturbed by incessant leaks that he has ordered attorney general Sessions to head the search. Sessions has told other cabinet members that the leaks cannot continue, and that drastic action will be taken to curtail them. He has threatened to subpoena reporters who may have learned of the leaks from the White House staff.The New York Times, in an editorial today that refused to identify sources, revealed that the current leakage is unrelated to the leak revealed in May. At that time, as reported in a Spoof exclusive, the problem was not technically a leak but was a backup and toilet overflow caused by an an ancient, unpumped White House cesspool. The Times' informants say the present issue is multiple leaks somewhere in an as yet undetermined pipe in the president's bathroom.Sean Spicer, filling in for the new press secretary as Spicer prepares to leave the White House staff, said that if Sessions is in fact seeking the source of the leak, he would indeed need plumbers but that neither the president nor the attorney general feel that term is acceptable today. Spicer suggested if the plumbers do exist, they be called pipe fitters.",0

372,Susan Sarandon's vagina: 'I am with Hillary',http://www.bentspud.com/news/politics/2016/03/29/susan-sarandons-vagina-i-am-with-hillary/,"Los Angeles, CA â In a startling turn of events, Susan Sarandonâs vagina has gone on record and declared she is throwing herfull support behind Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton.The move is in direct opposition to the actressâ spirited and sometimes aggressive backing of quirky socialist dreamer BernieSanders, who is Clintonâs last remaining stumbling block in the path to the Democratic presidential nomination.âSusan is right, she doesnât vote with her vagina,â said Sarandonâs vagina, referring to the actressâs Twitter post on whichshe said she doesnât vote with her female genitalia. âBecause I, like many other vaginas, have a mind and voice of my own, and for anyone to insinuate otherwise is incredibly insulting to vaginas everywhere.âSarandonâs vagina, who goes by the name Nancy Aubergine, said she believes that out of all the politicians running for the highestoffice in the United States of America, Hillary Clinton is the only one who has the realistic plan and the experience to steerthe country in the right direction.âAs a vagina, I truly believe in my heart of hearts that Hillary will do great things for America,â said Aubergine. âFor me,experience matters. Hillaryâs track record as a public servant speaks for itself.âAubergine added that she doesnât understand why Sarandon (and anyone for that matter) thinks Bernie Sanders would make a greatpresident.âI think itâs rich that a 74-year-old man who has been in politics longer than anyone running for president would paint himselfas a revolutionary while besmirching Secretary Clinton as being part of the establishment,â said Aubergine. âIf anyone is partof the establishment, itâs him. He invented the establishment.âLet me tell you, if Bernie Sanders were a gynecologist, I most certainly would not let him touch me with a 10-foot pole,â saidSarandonâs vagina.Hillary Clinton is currently leading the Democratic presidential race with 1,243 pledged delegates, while Bernie Sanders recentlypicked up an interest in ornithology.",0

374,Police Chiefs no longer want liberal Criminal Justice degree graduates as cops,no_url,As university graduation season comes to an end many young people are in for a rude awakening. Some employers dont want people with the degrees they have worked for years to earn.For decades many universities have placed Criminal Justice degrees under the Dean of Liberal Arts. Meaning these degrees were all about history and theory about deviance and social justice. Few liberal arts Criminal Justice degrees programs actually covered police tactics.Recently as liberal anti-police feelings have grown these CJ programs have shifted to also bashing police.Chief Irving from Sothern California explained it this way. We got a group of rookies who only want to argue with training officers. One kid said he refused to arrest anyone due to the stigma an arrest can have on their general wellbeing.Countless police administrators echo the complaints of Chief Irving.Deputy Chief Billets told us about a rookie who would not issue traffic tickets. This kid id out there pulling over speeders and then having them research traffic crash statistics and write an essay. He claims tickets unfairly penalize the poor. Better to have people learn a lesson in traffic safety than perpetuating a paupers prison system.Most of the Chiefs we talked to said they will no longer hire kids with a Criminal Justice degree. Degrees with real world skills like communications or human resources were pointed out as what future cops should have.,0

According to a press release, Trump was excited about the news. âIâm very happy to have Vladimir honor us with his presence,â said Trump. âIâll make sure the United States and Russia have the best relationship ever.â Trumpâs presidential win has been marred by intelligence reports that Russian hackers and propaganda helped sway the election in his favor. A recent report by BuzzFeed detailed an investigation by a former British intelligence agent who claims that the Russians are using sex tapes and financial ties to compromise Trump. Trumpâs election might indicate how much power Russia has over the United States. According to ThinkProgress, a recent speech by U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, which was critical of Trump, was knocked off C-SPAN and replaced by Russia Today, Putinâs propaganda outlet. âThe incident occurred six days after the U.S. intelligence community released its declassified intelligence report about Russiaâs meddling in the presidential election,â said ThinkProgress writer Aaron Rupar. âA significant portion of it details RTâs efforts to help Donald Trump.â",0

378,Steven Seagal on short list for new FBI director,no_url,"In the weeks after the FBI director was fired there has been speculation as to who will take over as Americas top cop. A White House insider has provided CallTheCops with a tip about one name on the list. Actor and reserve deputy Steven Seagal.Talking to us anonymously our source said the next FBI director needs to be someone with police experience and able to work with the current administration.Deputy Seagal would be a good fit. He has spent two decades as a deputy for Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. As an actor, he has trained with military special forces and many levels of Law Enforcement.Seagal got involved in Hollywood due to his background in Aikido. At one time he owned a dojo in Japan and later in California. His reputation in training others lead to his first acting gig in the movie Above The Law.In addition, Seagal had been contracted to teach Aikido to Russian Special Forces Units. This training has given Seagal a personal relationship with Vladimir Putin.His connection with Putin helps his chances. With the investigation into Russian hackers trying to rig the election, the FBI Director needs to be respected by the Russians. This is the man who can move this investigation forward.All of the FBI agents we talked to unwilling to go on record with their opinion on Seagal for the Director role.",0
379,Trump angers paramedics by calling them ambulance drivers in EMS week speech,no_url,"President Trump is overseas for the 2017 EMS week. But that fact is not what has EMS workers as upset as what Trump said in a recent speech. Trump called paramedics ambulance drivers.In a speech live streamed to various EMS week events the President praised the work done by all who render pre-hospital care. He drew criticism with many EMS works when at one point in his speech he said.TrumpI mean, I am a healthy man so we have never needed you to respond to my amazing penthouse in Trump Tower. Believe me, I know how incredible the men and woman ambulance drivers are, these are great people. We dont pay them a lot of money like doctors and nurses but they do the same incredible work.Many EMS shocked by this statement. It harkened back to a similar flub made by President Obama during a State of the Union Address.Later in his video stream, the President talked about how his reforms to the health care laws would allow him to raise the minimum wage for EMS workers. The president did not give an exact number.The discussion of EMS pay was a second insult to the many volunteer EMTs who serve US communities.EMT Jack Johnson said this. I thought he was all about supporting us folks in uniforms. Then he goes and calls us by a derogatory term. I do more than just drive the booboo bus. Pulse I do it for free. 100% volunteer here. Am I less of a medic because I dont get paid?City EMS director Chris Janson had this thought. After 30 years of being called an ambulance driver, I have gotten used to it. What bugs me more president after president gives a speech in person during police week. But during EMS week, nada we get shit.When asked for a comment Press Secretary Sean Spicer claims the term Ambulance Driver is an alternative title.",0
380,War on Christmas named bloodiest war since WWI,http://thedailyer.com/war-christmas-named-bloodiest-war-since-wwi/,"As Christmas season continues in full swing, many people are embracing the Christmas spirit by decorating the house, singing Christmas carols and getting in last-minute shopping. However, behind this jovial spirit lays the hideous and destructive nature that the Christmas media does not want you to know about.Just announced last Sunday, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that the War on Christmas has been named the bloodiest war since Americaâs involvement in World War I.The War on Christmas started as a harmless right-wing talking-point about how Jesus is being fazed out of Christmas, but has quickly turned into something far more treacherous.Although the phrase âbloodiest warâ may look alarming, Carter would like to point out that there have been no casualties in the War on Christmasâjust a whole lot of blood.âMore people have died from eating cereal than in the War on Christmas,â Carter reiterated using a fancy graph. âHowever, there been an ungodly amount of blood spilled during this battleâon the streets, at shopping malls, on set during live recording. Blood is everywhere, and as of right now we are still looking for causes.âThe search continues for answers as to where this record amount of blood is coming from, but Carter has a few leads.âWell, definitely keep our eyes peeled on certain hot spots: malls, offices, Fox News headquarters, specifically Bill OâReillyâs studioâthat man looks like he has a lot of blood in his body,â Carter said. âOur main focus, though, will be various Starbucks to see if any red cups make individuals angry enough to bleed profusely.âPolitical conspiracy theories often only cause citizens to be annoyed on Facebook and Twitter, but the War on Christmas has reached new levels of terror, making this the bloodiest, yet least dangerous, war of all time. This may not be the most pressing issue, Carter said, but blood on the streets is something he wants to end.âIâm not a doctor. I do not know much about the human body, but I know losing blood to a media talking point is bad,â Carter said. âRight now, itâs important to remain calm and remember that the War on Christmas will end when we all put away our decorations and start celebrating the new year.â",0

Chemicals found on fire scenes and absorbed into turnout gear have been linked to many illness. Now a chemical found in fire hose is raising an alarm.Fire AttackA newly published scientific study in the Journal of Chemical Reaction and Human Hazards in Extreme Workplace Environments, sheds light on this new chemical danger.According to the studyâ¦Dihydrogen Monoxide is a colorless and odorless chemical compound. At room temperatures it is a non-viscous liquid, but at high temperatures as found in fires it can turn into a vapor.Inhalation of Dihydrogen Monoxide can cause respiratory distress. Death will result from an excessive amount being inhaled.Exposure to the vapor from Dihydrogen Monoxide will cause burns. Again death is a possibility with an excessive exposure.Fire hoses release Dihydrogen Monoxide during normal firefighting operations.The researchers offered no recommendations on dealing with the dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide. There have been no long term studies to check the effects Dihydrogen Monoxide contact has with human and the likely hood of it triggering other illnesses.More studies on the effects of Dihydrogen Monoxide will be needed to find out the full extent of the danger to firefighters.",0

Orange Throat said the White House is like ââGame of Thronesâ with less blood.â Trump also reportedly considered firing White House advisor Steve Bannon, when he started getting more praise than him. According to the Washington Post, an unnamed White House insider also compared the ongoing carnage to HBOâs âGame of Thrones.â âPriebusâ final departure was a humiliating coda for what had been a largely demeaning tenure during which he endured regular belittling from rival advisers â and even, at times, the president himself. His exit was described by one Republican strategist as âthe red wedding,â a reference to a mass-murder blood bath episode of HBOâs âGame of Thrones,ââ said the Post.",0
383,The 5 Stupidest People On The Planet (Are All Donald Trump),http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-5-stupidest-people-planet-are-all-donald-trump/,"How many times are you allowed to say or do something stupid before you realize you yourself are stupid? Seven times? 24? Butts? Rush Limbaugh has been wrong about 270 things a day for 40 years, and he would be truly shocked to learn he's stupid. We aren't good at spotting our own intellectual limitations. We walk around thinking we're brilliant, no matter how many times we get our head stuck in an alligator or our genitals stuck in an alligator. I can prove it: I think I'm smart enough to write an article on intelligence, and the only book I've read is the movie Bloodsport. I also recently typed the number butts. Twice. Hold on, butts times now.The cluelessly stupid are a diverse and colorful community, but most of them fall into one of five distinct categories. I'll include a famous example of each one, which may end up getting confusing, since our dumbfuck president is somehow the example for all five. So here is a list of dumb idiots, which is maybe the best idea I've had for an article since 8 Album Covers White People Could Never Pull Off or Your 3rd Grade Textbook, Only Written By Gary Busey. Here's the book cover for when it inevitably gets adapted into national bestseller:One last thing before we start. I imagine that some of you have already taken the idea of this article personally, and you're keenly watching for any logical flaw, strawman fallacy, or typo which will allow you to dismiss me as a totally wrong hypocrite.

There are no rules to declaring yourself an expert. And when you're self-important enough to think universally shared experiences are yours alone, you become a Keeper of the Common Knowledge.*Cheese-up, while generously fingering your lover's pepperoni chakra. You're welcome, couples.Read NextThe One Good Thing That Could Come From The NYT Nazi PieceA Keeper of the Common Knowledge can become a leading mind on a subject after a Wikipedia paragraph or a few hazy childhood memories. Here's how it works: Every day, about 4,500 American tourists check into Paris hotels. After a few days of standard vacation packaging, they come home, and their barely noteworthy trip is only brought up every time France is mentioned for the rest of their lives. But for a Keeper of the Common Knowledge, those three days offered an insight into a culture so complete that they know the mysterious French people better than they know themselves.A Keeper of Common Knowledge offers their wisdom when you need it least. They are bursting with things no person could possibly not know, and it spills out at the slightest relevance. They might insert themselves into a discussion about pro wrestling only to explain it's fake. If you make eye contact with them at a buffet, they give conspiratorial advice, like how to pile the most expensive foods into little shrines honoring your victory over the restaurant. They interrupt movies to share arcane knowledge like how guns are quite noisy or hanging from a cliff makes your arms tired. They're the kind of person who tells you not to use shampoo as a lubricant, as if they're the inventor of making love to a bowling ball. Let me spend Valentine's Day however I want, genius.â Continue Reading BelowHelping Understand Keepers Of The Common Knowledge With Stupid President Donald TrumpRemember when Trump was always saying he was the best at military? That wasn't a crafty lie to get the tank loader vote; he really thinks that. But why? How? He dodged military service with a note from his gynecologist, and the only book on war he's read is a Hitler cat recipe book. Well, I've done my best to piece together how he came to think of himself as the greatest military mind of our time. It's pretty amazing how many personality and mental disorders had to come together to make it happen. Keep in mind that I'm not a licensed doctor and can't diagnose him. However, I do know that popular disabled impersonator Donald Trump has so much evil inside him that his proctologist's ungloved fingers now add an anus to any flesh they touch. When Trump got an MRI, the computer just showed an image of his daughter squatting over Jesus Christ and peeing into his missing eyes. With that in mind, let's examine the 4D chessboard the commander in chief calls his ""very good brain.""During the debates, Donald complained that George Patton was spinning in his grave because we announced we were going into Mosul. ""Why not go in quiet?"" he asked many times. It was most likely rhetorical, but also so ignorant that one moderator accidentally answered it for him. Also, Patton famously led an insane decoy army to distract the Nazis. Saying he's spinning in his grave over someone being bold is like saying, ""I didn't even read the Netflix description of the movie about the guy I'm invoking"" and then adding, ""It is truly impossible to miss how terrible I am. I am a walking DO NOT IRON WHILE WEARING SHIRT label. People see me and wonder what helplessly uninformed assholes created a need for me.""Trump kept referring to a secret military plan to defeat ISIS which he would only reveal after he was made president. This lie was almost cute, like when your boyfriend pretends he knew it was your birthday, or when Mike Huckabee's son says, ""The dog was ritually murdered this way when I found it!"" But I don't think Trump was lying! He really thought he had solved ISIS when his very good brain invented the ""sneak attack."" Paradoxically, he knew it was brilliant, but also so obvious that the generals were stupid for not thinking of it. I know a lot of absurdity is getting thrown around in this article, but he actually said that, and Mike Huckabee's son actually murdered a dog. And Trump's proctologist absolutely adds buttholes to all flesh he touches. It happens so often that he's stopped apologizing for it.â Continue Reading BelowFrom what I can tell, the rest of Trump's military tactics are made up entirely of war crimes. One morning, convicted fraudster Donald Trump called in to a talk show to suggest we kill the families of terrorists. In one of his first executive briefings, he asked three times why we can't use nuclear weapons if we have them. That's his understanding of modern warfare -- he thinks all the bad people travel in one bombable group, moving to a new town every time the guileless United States military announces it's coming. Which means their only weakness is the first president with enough balls to instantly and without warning murder their children. It's weird, because most clinical sociopaths know that in order to blend in, they're at least supposed to pretend human life has value.Trump sounds like a guy who had atomic bombs explained to him by an ill-advised puppet show, but he assured us that ""There's nobody that understands the horrors of nuclear better than me."" How deep does our president's record-breaking understanding of the horror of nuclear go? Well, in the most aggressively uninformed statement ever made by a dumbest man in the room, he told reporters, ""You know what uranium is, right? It's this thing called nuclear weapons. And other things. Like, lots of things are done with uranium. Including some bad things.""Those words came out of his mouth. After bragging about being the leading nuclear mind on the planet! No, you don't get it. You, me, all of us, we now live in a world where anything can happen. Our president, the PRESIDENT, knows three war things -- sneak attacks are surprise, nuclear is some bad things, nothing fucking else -- and with all his heart, he believes he is a military genius. And we, the people who all knew at least those same things, believed him! We put him in charge of the military! You can absolutely fuck off if that doesn't prove magic is real.â Continue Reading BelowThere's a soothing belief among the unskilled and dumb that every issue is simple and knowledge is a pointless endeavor. A Pure Intellect Untainted by Expertise thinks they have a refreshing outsider's take on every issue. They say things like ""Hollywood should only make daring, original films"" or ""The cure for the obesity epidemic is fucking eating less"" or ""Have depressed people tried not being sad?"" Everything is so easy to solve if you stop ignoring the obvious answer!There is a lot of appeal in thinking any of the world's problems can be fixed with your no-nonsense telling it like it is. In fact, our movies and TV shows cater to it. They manufacture situations in which the obvious solution is ignored until the doofus character suggests an extremely common-sense idea. The others say something like ""My- my God, it's so simple it's brilliant!"" If you're dumb enough, it feels like they're talking to you! Let me give you an example.Remember in Top Gun, when Maverick is being chased by an enemy jet through the danger zone? He's going to die if he can't get behind them, but how? Easy: He's going to slam on the brakes, and they will fly right by. No one in the movie can believe it. That shit isn't in the Pilot Rulebook, Maverick! But rules and pilots will never replace raw street smarts like the kind you and Maverick have. Personally, I'm so street smart that I don't even wonder how the jet already had brakes if Maverick was the first guy to invent the idea of slowing down a jet with jet brakes. I'm so street smart that I would have thrown a bowling ball out the window and said ""She broke my heart too, pal!"" as it smashed into the enemy pilot's chest, making a perfect comedic callback to earlier, when I was having sex with that bowling ball.Here's an example from a movie that isn't 31 years old:""ACTUALLY, I'M HIGHLY LOGICAL, WHICH ALLOWS ME TO LOOK PAST EXTRANEOUS DETAIL AND PERCEIVE CLEARLY THAT WHICH OTHERS OVERLOOK."" -- A Line Seriously Written Into a Movieâ Continue Reading BelowHave you ever noticed how in sports movies, there's always a wildcard character who ends up being the best at the sport because they've never heard of it? They hit the golf ball or kick the football furthest because they haven't cluttered their brain with pointless ""knowledge."" Or maybe they're unstoppable at basketball because they're a caveman, or a dog. If you're fetally alcoholed enough, these movies send a truly comforting message: Your lack of knowledge is specifically what will make you great at things. And think of how many things you don't know how to do. But not too hard; you don't want to accidentally understand anything so well that you become bad at it, like George Lucas did with Star Wars or Gamergate did with women.Helping Understand Pure Intellects Untainted By Expertise With Stupid President Donald TrumpKnowing nothing about how to do something but also being the only one who can do it is Donald Trump's defining philosophy. He went into his campaign telling everyone how he knew nothing about politics, and that's virtually the only thing he didn't lie about. But of all his shortcomings, nothing demonstrates a Pure Intellect Untainted by Expertise as much as his stupid fucking Mexico WALL.To think a wall is the solution to drugs, illegal immigration, or human trafficking requires a spectacular lack of knowledge. You have to carefully not read the first sentence of the first Google result on any of the issues. Most undocumented immigrants arrive legally and overstay their visas. Nothing has stopped drugs ever. I don't have all the stats on human trafficking, but every Staples I called said that they haven't printed an unusually high number of SEX SLAVE LIQUIDATION SALE signs since Trump announced he wanted a fence.I'm already attacking the problem with facts, and our president wouldn't know a fact if it unraveled his combover and rappelled down Trump Tower. A human should know a wall wouldn't work simply by remembering what they know about walls. And since we live in an amazing time when anything can happen, we've actually witnessed Donald Trump accidentally think too hard about his wall and figure out that it wouldn't work.In November of last year, Trump was explaining walls to a crowd. He reassured them that no one could scale his wall by saying, ""There's no ladder going over there."" He then took a long, silent thought ... maybe to consider whether Mexicans have ladder technology? He caveated, ""If they ever get up there, they're in trouble, 'cause there's no way to get down."" Still deep in thought, he added, ""... maybe a rope."" And with that, he debunked his own fence, almost a year ago, by inadvertently thinking about it for just the smallest amount of time.â Continue Reading BelowSince then, it seems like any time Trump talks about the subject for too long, he'll remember another way to defeat a wall and have to add a feature. He once remembered that you can dig under walls, so he added special vibration-sensing anti-tunnel technology. He once misunderstood what someone meant by the word ""transparent,"" and insisted that yeah, it was important to make the wall transparent so you can see the giant bags of drugs falling over it. And when he remembered that hammers can smash through walls, he suggested we fill it with, no bullshit, nuclear waste. There was also some talk of solar panels and a railroad. So now this thing senses vibrations (except for its own railroad), is climb-proof, is immune to everything but rope, and they're going to fill it with nuclear waste, which you can see because the wall is transparent. Also it's made of solar panels. So maybe this is an example of how knowing nothing about a thing sometimes can make you the best at it. Because Trump knows less about walls than a free-range chicken's limitless dreams, and he somehow designed the sweetest goddamn wall in the world.The Determined Fool decided many years ago that they were extremely correct about something. Maybe they picked a political party, or a video game console, or the concept of snakes as pets. Whatever it was, they went about building their identity around the simple, unquestionable truth of that thing's supremacy. Since absolute certainty is a trait shared only by the very stupid, it turns out they were wrong. About everything. The alien-worshiping religion or the perpetually sued president they chose did not in fact end man's quest for universal truth. So now their life is devoted to developing the insanities necessary to keep their minds from noticing their mistake.â Continue Reading BelowThe human brain is an amazing organ. It can keep the Determined Fool ignorant even in the face of overwhelming education. In fact, proving to a Determined Fool how they are wrong usually only makes them more wrong. But who am I to say what's real? Our perception is just the interface we use to interpret a Universe of unknown wonders. I think it was Guy Fieri who once honked the horn on his top-down Chevelle and screamed, ""Truth is a fleeting concept, like a slippery dildo in a dildo sweepstakes booth, weeknights at 8 on the Food Network!""I found this image in a folder called DRUNK PHOTOSHOP and thought ""I'll never find a place for whatever this is, drunk me."" In your face, sober me.No one has a handle on truth, but 2,300 years ago, Aristotle said that the best truth is usually the one balanced between two extremes. So how are the most extreme people always the most sure they're right? It's been a dumb thing to think since they literally fucking invented how to think. Completely unaware of this, the Determined Fool starts political wars from indefensible positions like ""trickle-down economics"" or ""Let's hear these Nazis out."" Luckily, they have an arsenal of behavioral problems and logical fallacies to help them move out of any checkmate. For instance, maybe you decided you support Trump because he's a great businessman who tells it like it is. Fine. So you bought a little hat, masturbated to a picture of the nude first lady, and warned the Muslim in your building that Sharia law is no longer welcome in America. You're just the worst. A true piece of shit, like back when America was great.Then you read an article about how Trump has failed in every business he ever started, sometimes intentionally to launder Russian mafia money. And it turns out his immigration policy is just something called ""racial intolerance."" Also, you find a study revealing that more than 80 percent of the things Trump says are wrong -- sometimes from dishonesty, but often from weirdly comprehensive dumbness. Oh man, this Trump guy? I think you really blew it. I wrote an online quiz that might help you understand.â Continue Reading BelowSo what are you supposed to do now? Get a refund for your hat? Apologize to the Muslim in your building who turned out to be something called ""a Sikh""? Why bother? There are no consequences for anything, and your garbage brain can easily convince itself the media was lying. Plus, history eventually proves all racists to be right about daughter-killing immigrants, which because of Sharia law is perfectly legal in your Muslim neighbor's apartment. And with those simple mental gymnastics, boom, America is great again.Neuroscientists call this type of nimble stupidity ""cognitive dissonance,"" but I'm not a neuroscientist. I'm a man who types things like ""a shrieking Guy Fieri trying to justify an all-rib diet to his own hickory-smoked diarrhea."" That's what the Determined Fool is: someone bursting with shit who would rather pitch you on a world of diarrhea fountains than deal with their own problems.Man invented the scientific method 400 years ago, when Galileo thought to sometimes ask, ""What if we're wrong about this?"" They teach it to third-graders. So try to remember this: Every single time you're 100 percent convinced you're right, you're dumber than a 17th-century leech farmer or an eight-year-old C student. Even if you turn out to be right. You hopeless, self-brainwashing diarrhea fountain salesman.Helping Understand Determined Fools With Stupid President Donald TrumpNot all Determined Fools have minds elastic enough for cognitive dissonance. In order to hang onto their harmful, evil, self-destructive, or otherwise dumbass beliefs, some have to resort to false equivalencies. Like when Trump was asked how he feels about Putin being a killer, and he said, ""So what? Other people are killers too!"" That's how seductive false equivalencies can be to a simple mind. These fucks end up arguing FOR murder and FOR Nazis, and they think they're making, like, a point?Since basic human decency is now a political issue, some of you were already thinking ""THE LEFT DOES IT TOO!"" Sure, buddy. There are other things wrong in the world besides murder and Nazis. For example, your mother's footjob game. And sure, for every ten Gamergaters threatening to kill a girl for abiding a black Human Torch, there is a Twitter warrior who chose to support feminism with an overly harsh meme. But sanctimonious heroism isn't anything like being a Nazi. And nothing any Democrat will ever do is similar to bragging about grabbing pussies while you're married to a model you bought from Slovenia. If you're confused, always remember: When two things are described with different words and have different meanings, they aren't the same. You don't get to lie and murder and be Kenyan just because Obama does it too.â Continue Reading BelowWhen your world is built on top of something as flaky as religion or politics, it's exhausting. You have to defend nonsense all day because you don't know which crack in your foundation will require you to rebuild your entire belief system. That's a ton of work. I still convince myself electronic music is fun because it's easier than developing rhythm. People still chase children with knives because it's faster than explaining why they became a clown. But if your beliefs are so flimsy that they shatter as soon as you admit a mistake, let them shatter. You can rebuild a far superior personality and system of values with a single episode of Super Friends.â Continue Reading BelowWhat if I told you that television shows were dangerous? It's true. In the year 2000, four out of every five injuries occurred in a home that owned a VHS copy of Robocop III. Someone might say, ""That's compelling Robocorrelation, but that data alone does not suggest Robocausation."" Fine. But maybe your first instinct was to say, ""Robocop III is a movie, not a TV show, you fucking dumbass."" If so, then congratulations, idiot, you're a Technical Genius. You're smart enough to spot a technicality, but too dumb to know everyone else did too and it was light years away from the point. You're the kind of person who tells your doctor, ""Um, it's Chief Chirpa?"" when he tells you that getting the Wicket doll out of your asshole will require surgery. ""And, um,"" you'll add, ""it's an action figure? Maybe you should have gone to a non-stupid medical school.""He died as he lived: a shitty mistake. Coatee-cha tu, yub nub.The nice thing about being a Technical Genius is that it feels like proof you're smarter than everyone. They can say you don't ""get it"" all day, but they're the imbeciles who think Robocop III is a TV show. Look at it like this: You are the only one in the history of Koala Times Bus Tours to contract syphilis from a koala bite. You might be embarrassed, but at least you aren't like those other fools screaming ""Don't touch the koala bears!"" when they are in fact marsupials. I mean, if koalas were actual bears, your whole face would be missing, not still here and covered in pulsing chancres.Technical Geniuses reach maximum annoying when they decide that pointing out technicalities is a sense of humor. For instance, if you announced, ""My wife is pregnant and we're having a boy,"" a Technical Genius might quip, ""Well, technically only women can have babies. Unless you count the Chief Chirpa action figure currently breaching my anus -- um, which you should, since it is the dictionary definition. Heard of it? Hey, everyone! This idiot with no dictionary is watching me shit out a Chief Chirpa, and he doesn't even know which gender gives birth!""Technical Geniuses have such a rigid understanding of the rules of language that they miss the meaning behind words. They mistake sarcasm for a mistake that needs correcting. Their idea of wordplay is assuming you meant the wrong homonym, which makes them both a walking Family Circus cartoon and the person condescendingly explaining to the Family Circus characters how ""cool"" may sometimes refer to ""tubular"" instead of temperature. And god help you if you get into a written discussion with them, as the tiniest typo can turn even the most important debate into a fourth-grade grammar lesson. They'd rather tell you that ""non whites"" should have a hyphen rather than agree that killing them is wrong.â Continue Reading BelowFor the most part, the Technical Genius just derails conversations with unlikeability. But their fierce misunderstanding of unspoken rules can lead to problems way more serious. You know what happens when you can't see past the immediate and literal meaning of words? Well, I'll show you. It's technically unfair how there's no ""White"" History Month or ""White"" Entertainment Television, right? And fine, black lives matter, but isn't it MORE loving and accepting to say that ALL lives matter? See? I'm only two sentences into my life as a Technical Genius, and I've already talked myself into racism. All it took was the limited observation skills of a bad '90s standup routine with the deliberate cultural ignorance of a bad '90s standup routine.Remember when that panty-dropper at Google got fired for writing, word-for-word, how women aren't good at robots because of their emotions and milk-squirting nipples? That guy was absolutely a Technical Genius. Men and women are different, sure, but if you're either of those things, you already knew that. You also might know how, almost always, these differences aren't worth mentioning and vary from person to person. Yes, a woman is a bad hire if you need someone to stand next to a wolf for 29 days without bleeding. But even as someone who's not a wolf scientist, I can think of a few workarounds: wolf nose plugs, baking soda underpants, menopause, chaining the wolf out of vagina-biting range ... are we sure we even need to fill this standing-near-a-wolf position? See, this is how a healthy mind operates -- it solves problems, asks questions, and keeps ladies safe from crotch-biting predators because it's the right thing to do. A Technical Genius makes a short-sighted, clumsy observation and acts like they put all reason in checkmate. You know who could explain this better than me? The outrageously bad con man the worst 20 percent of our population voted into the White House.Helping Understand Technical Geniuses With Stupid President Donald Trumpâ Continue Reading BelowThis is a classic example of a Technical Genius. To this dumbshit, it seems like he's turned the tables on the entire concept of racial oppression. He raises the same point made by most clueless fucks on their first day of imaginary struggle: ""How come whites can't do one of the things blacks do? Isn't that the REAL persecution?"" It's worse than ignorant. It's the kind of childlike question you might ask the Star Trek crew if you're a checkerboarded alien who knows nothing of their world's Ray Sizzum.There are different rules, unspoken or not, for every caste, race, and gender. You have to play some pretty intense make-believe to say you don't know that. And only the dimmest, pussiest of white people invent their own oppression, like not being allowed to say ""Merry Christmas"" or ""the N-word."" I'm not either, but I bet white billionaires have different troubles than the characters on Black-ish, and it seems impossible that Donald Trump hasn't had this explained to him by Omarosa's hairdresser many times.The things Technical Geniuses say are often so frustratingly wrong but also ""not wrong"" that they act as traps. Your every instinct is to add context to them, but don't -- you will only become them. Look again at our evil president's ""Black-ish"" tweet. You might feel the urge to correct the five grammatical mistakes he made in its three sentences, but any decent person should feel compelled as fuck to explain just the most basic, introductory concepts of race to him. This grown man thinks that the unfairness of having a show called Black-ish when there's not one called ""Whiteish"" is ""racism at highest level."" That means you have to start your explanation with ""Um, have you heard of a little thing called slavery?"" And look what's happened. You're the one saying dumb, obvious shit now.â Continue Reading BelowSometimes a stupid person starts to figure out that their brain doesn't work as well as everyone else's. Maybe they looked around their home and realized they only owned books by Ann Coulter on how to identify different Asians by which part of the human they eat. Or maybe they watch The Big Bang Theory, which for eight seasons has just been Jim Parsons staring directly into a camera and repeating ""You are an idiot ape. You are a mindless sack of tepid water."" It's true, Big Bang Theory viewers, and I'm the only one with the courage to say it.Discovering your own intellectual shortcomings is terrifying, especially for the insecure. So some of them create a new reality, one with rules carefully constructed to make them brilliant. The disorder starts simply enough. Your friend tells you that birthday meals are free at any restaurant if you tell them you're a registered sex offender. Later, Yahoo Answers tells you that impersonating a sex offender is not technically a crime. Later still, in jail, you decide you hate being tricked. They become the Untrickable.The Untrickable believes that not being fooled is the pickle of human intelligence, but we assume they mean pinnacle. For a person to avoid being fooled, they need deep, multi-dimensional knowledge. Luckily, there is a shortcut: Assume everything is trying to fool you. Assume every video you watch is fake, and use that single word to describe each of them in the comments section. You'll find that not only do you suddenly feel smart, but you're also significantly smarter than anyone who has ever believed in ""God"" or ""science"" or ""Guy Fieri not being a toilet brush brought to life by a lonely plumber's wish.""There's only one problem with this: When everything is fake, nothing is. You start solving mundane mysteries with ""ghosts."" Lizard men infiltrating a Target becomes exactly as likely as non-lizards asking you to leave for trying to pull human masks off the customers. The flatness of the Earth becomes a frustrating reminder of how no one else is smart enough to see through the lies of Big Fact. Luckily, our president is 100 percent immune to the lies of Big Fact.Helping Understand The Untrickables With Extremely Never-Tricked President Donald TrumpTrump has the unique mix of confidence, paranoia, and ignorance that creates a perfectly untrickable person. He thinks global warming, a savagely obvious thing only one political party in one of the world's countries isn't aware of, is a scheme to undermine America's industry. He thinks the same thing about the Paris Climate Accords and regulations against dumping coal sludge into drinking water. It would take two minutes to teach a six-year-old Honduran immigrant the English necessary to teach Donald Trump why he's wrong about any of these things. Which would, at best, lead to a tweet claiming that Mexican children are a scheme to destroy America's industry.",0
384,Your Anti-Trump Efforts Are Working,http://www.cracked.com/blog/dont-get-discouraged-real-political-change-takes-time/,"Hi! I'm writing to you from day 116 of the Trump presidency, a period future historians will refer to as ""Oh God, We're Not Even Through Half A Year Yet?"" My social media feeds are currently dominated by discussion, gossip, and flat-out panic over both Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey and Trump's leaking of classified information to Russia. A few days earlier everyone was concerned that Trump was going to start a nuclear war with North Korea, and God only knows what the next scandal will be. Maybe Trump cuts trade with Ireland because Kathy Ireland said something mean about him. Anyway, the current mood is ... not optimistic.TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterThere are thousands more, and that's all from one single day of the news cycle. Trump has made dozens of ridiculous headlines since coming to power, and there have been endless overreactions to every single one. Every new day brings, to some people, definitive proof that the Republic has fallen or undeniable evidence that Trump should, nay, must be impeached. When that doesn't happen, they're either relieved that America still functions or distraught that evil incarnate remains in office, and the emotional roller coaster begins all over again.That's how social media works, of course -- the most lurid statements rise to the top like shit cream, while any attempt at nuance is ignored because calm, rational thought can't be crammed into 140 characters and emojis. So every single day we're told that America is teetering on the edge of ruin and that we should be in a constant state of national existential dread.I obviously can't predict the future, because if I could I would've included pre-emptive burns on anyone who calls me dumb for writing this. So hey, maybe American democracy will collapse tomorrow. Or maybe Trump will be impeached over the weekend and everything wrong with America will be magically fixed and we can all go back to watching puppy videos and porn. I don't think that's likely, though. Everyone going on about how Trump has had his ""Watergate moment.""Voxnews.com.auDaily MirrorThe New York TimesThe Independent""Exhausted Nation Demands New Political Analogy""... forgets that Watergate wasn't a moment. The criminal activity began in early 1972. Nixon resigned on August 8, 1974. In between was a daily grind of reporting and protests and people going on with their lives -- none of which benefited from panicky overreactions about how the nation was doomed. So buckle in for the long haul. Whatever comes from recent exhausting events, and all the exhausting events of the future, it's unlikely to happen overnight.CNNBut social media doesn't thrive on people quietly grinding through their days. It thrives on alarmism, on making every day sound like the most elaborate and shocking episode yet in the soap opera that is reality. And that depresses people because if you gaze too long into the abyss, the abyss asks Mike Huckabee to tell you a shitty ""joke.""TwitterIt doesn't work on so many levels!Constant outrage and fear are not healthy. It makes people stressed, tired, and sad. And it makes people wonder when something will be done. Well, things have been done. But you aren't being given a chance to savor them because other people are constantly yelling at you about how today's new development is definitely the one that changes history forever and anyone who believes otherwise is a traitor. So let's pause for a moment and take stock.Trump's ""Muslim ban"" was shot down, both by the courts and by massive protests around the country. The Women's March in late January drew as many as 4.6 million people, making it one of the largest protests in American history. There was also a March for Science, a March for Trump's tax returns, and a March for Climate. People are turning up in droves at Town Halls to express themselves, and politicians are taking notice. Companies like Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, and Kmart have dropped Trump's product line in the wake of a protest campaign. Trump's pick for labor secretary failed. So did his picks for secretary of the Navy, and secretary of the Army. Trump's first attempt at healthcare failed and his second is probably going to die or be significantly altered in the Senate, in no small part because voters spoke out against it. ACLU membership has tripled, and they've raked in 80 million dollars in donations. I could go on.I know that, in the grand scheme of things, none of that looks like enough. Protests don't feel like they're accomplishing anything when Trump gets to touch his sweaty, withered balls to the sheets of the White House master bedroom every weekday night. ACLU memberships offer little succor if you're worried about losing your health insurance or a loved one getting deported.But that's how progress is made. Slowly, steadily, with purpose. There's no dramatic, ready-for-Hollywood moment where one plucky reporter finds the smoking gun that forces Trump to resign in disgrace, or where one especially scathing celebrity zinger gives him a rage-induced heart attack. Instead, you get enough people to care about objecting to his policies that their will can't be ignored. And you keep doing it, day after tedious day until you get enough people to care about voting him out. You make your beliefs and hopes heard, over and over and over again, even if people don't want to listen. All of those protests and actions I just rattled off are the early steps in that process.MicThey're some pretty big steps, though.As someone who gets mad at the toaster when it seems to be taking four seconds longer than last week, I get the desire for instant gratification. But that's the outrage and fear cycle feeding you. Remember how we were definitely 100 percent sure we were going to nuclear war with North Korea and then we all forgot about it a week later because a new story developed? It works both ways. Trump isn't being impeached by lunchtime, probably not at all, despite what everyone is screaming on Twitter. That doesn't mean progress isn't being made! But it's a painfully slow and frustrating process, like building a sand castle one grain at a time. Your actions are a few of those grains, even if it rarely feels that way.Also, at the risk of sounding like your mom, take a break. It's important to stay informed, but America isn't going to collapse overnight if you blow off the news for an evening to watch cartoons. Also at the risk of sounding like your mom, I have an incredible penis and I know just how to use it. See? Take some time to enjoy a personal interest and don't feel guilty about it. You can't advance your beliefs if you're stressed, anxious, and convinced that the world is about to end.This is a marathon, not a sprint. The finish line is miles away, even if social media is claiming that it's right in front of you. Your small donation to a cause you believe in, or that nice thing you did for your worried friend might seem pointless if the world is falling apart -- like some people would have you believe -- but those little steps are how you finish a marathon. Keep taking them ... they're working.",0
385,The Secret Good President Trump Is Doing For America,http://www.cracked.com/blog/trump-hero-we-need-not-one-we-want-right-now/,"FacebookTwitterAdd to FavoritesI just want to take a moment to give a big, warm, heartfelt thank you to secret hero Donald Trump. Shout-out to you, Donald! Nate Silver's website, FiveThirtyEight, has reported evidence that you have actually managed to stunt right-wing movements around the world just by being so shitty. The truth is startlingly clear now: You are intentionally being the world's worst leader, selflessly sacrificing your own legacy -- and indeed, your own dignity -- in order to stop the progress of the far-right and make the world a better place. And boy are you doing a great job. You are a tragic, misunderstood hero, and while history may paint you as a villain (all according to your ingenious seven-dimensional chess plan), we would like to take a moment to offer an ode to your accomplishments.Nate Silver explains that there's a solid pattern evident: The warmer a foreign leadership candidate's relationship with Trump, the worse he or she has tended to do in elections. This remarkably consistent trend has seen right-wing parties face embarrassing results in Austria, the Netherlands, France, and the UK. Trump, your act of being an incompetent asshole has truly set the nationalist cause back by decades, a result of your labyrinthian political strategy too complex for most small minds to comprehend. A brilliant political martyr whose sacrifice may be forgotten by history books, but not by us.Even in Australia, the Liberal prime minister (Australia's Liberal Party is conservative, the toilets flush the other way, it's just a whole Australian thing) was seen in a leaked video comically mimicking Trump in front of fellow politicians and journalists. Trump, your efforts at making yourself appear to be an idiot of legendary proportions are being appreciated all the way down under.Let's take a look at some of the terrible and idiotic things our revered martyr Trump has done for the good of the world:Firing The Director Of The FBI For Being DisloyalHistorically, a president would generally avoid firing the FBI director out of respect for the independence of law enforcement -- in other words, it's not a good look. And when that FBI director is leading an investigation into your possible ties with Russia? No man would think he can do this and come out seeming innocent or competent -- that is, unless he's intentionally making himself seem treacherous. This brilliant move has done a great service in making right-wing nationalists look cartoonishly sinister. Wonderful work, Mr. President.ABC NewsYou put Sun Tzu to shame.Attacking London's Muslim Mayor Hours After A Terrorist AttackWhat a great way to make the right wing seem jaw-droppingly cold-hearted. Really White Fang-ing the empathetic people of the world, you know? Throwing rocks at us out of love, because you know we're better off without an authoritarian world filled with toxic patriotism. Accusing London's first Muslim mayor of being indifferent to terrorism and suggesting a knife attack with minimal casualties somehow validated your pro-gun stance, and also repeating the call for a ban on Muslim immigration? I'm stunned at the artistry demonstrated here. A colder performance than Kathy Bates in Misery. We see what we you're doing, and we love you for it.Golfing In Mar-a-Lago ConstantlyCosting the American taxpayers $10 million on three weekend golfing trips? Like they say, you've got to spend money to make money, and in this case we're spending money to drag the world out of this poverty-stricken, nationalistic cesspit. The average American might not see through your clever ruse, but I know no one truly enjoys golf that much. And no one wants to make such a terrible impression in their first month at a new job! You're one of the world's most successful businessmen, come on. When you're one day impeached, I'll be silently weeping from the crowd, tapping my nose like a co-conspirator in a noir film. I know the sacrifices you made, and I will think of you with bittersweet joy every time I salute that damn flag.angusfrasermktg/PixabayThis one too.Blurting Out Bits Of Highly Classified InformationFor a movement rooted in patriotism and love of country, probably the greatest way to alienate even your own supporters is to share classified intelligence on a whim to a Russian ambassador, making yourself seem either terribly incompetent or actively endangering your citizens. Either way, it's a huge win for those of us who want to see the far right crushed. You're the Batman to our Gotham. We barely deserve you.Demanding Passage Of A Healthcare Bill That Would Even Hurt His Own SupportersThrowing your support behind a bill that would throw millions of Americans off their health insurance plans, including people who voted for you? Leaving millions of people to, well, probably die, and directly violating your campaign promises? Not even Hannibal Lecter is that deeply evil. Not sure I agree with literally sacrificing lives for the cause of making the movement look bad, but hey, I trust your magnificent vision of a better world. We're in safe hands. I only wish that more people saw you for what you truly are: a hero saint bravely disguised as a turd.",0
386,A Simple Explanation Of Trump's Russia Scandal,http://www.cracked.com/blog/a-simple-timeline-all-trumprussia-news/,"Wow, what a week to be burdened with literacy and a conscience. It doesn't even matter where you sit on the political spectrum -- Left, Right or in a corner softly weeping -- every fan in DC was caked with shit being thrown from all sides. So much happened that it can be pretty confusing to keep it all together, and it's even more confusing when you factor in that so much news was jumping back and forth from things that happened weeks or months ago to real-time insanity. Luckily for you, I abuse drugs meant for horses, so I took the time to let someone else at work research it for me so I could give it to you!April to November of 2016Turns out that during Donald Trump's presidential campaign, not only was he selling record numbers of ugly hats (don't hate, you know it's true), but his cadre of questionably scrupled pals also had a few more undisclosed meetings with Russians than we were aware of. And by ""a few"" I mean 18. 18 undisclosed contacts with Russians.A lot of these contacts seem to be between Michael Flynn, disgraced national security advisor, and Sergei Kislyak, Russian supermodel and ambassador. The nature of the contacts was email and phone calls. Can we assume a romance? It's up to the FBI to find the sexts. For now, the focus is on their efforts to set up backchannel communications -- which, again, sounds like romance. You know, for some of us.June 15, 2016In what must be a super fun, party-like shindig, awesome dudebro Paul Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy have a meeting wherein the topic of Russia and Ukraine came up, and McCarthy casually mentions that he feels Trump is on Russian payroll. Specifically, McCarthy says, ""There's two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,"" referring to California Congressman Dana ""The Mad Russian"" Rohrabacher.Some folks laugh at McCarthy's claim, then Ryan says ""No leaks!"" A good time is had by all. Those involved at first denied the conversation ever took place, until it was pointed out that it's on tape, after which they decided it was clearly just jokes. C'mon man, don't you know a knee-slapper when you hear one?January 4, 2017Ruh-roh! Despite assertions that the Trump team had no idea Flynn was more foreign than a guy in a Speedo on the beach, word is that they had been given plenty of advanced warning. It was Flynn himself who told White House lawyer Donald McGahn that he was being investigated for being a shady foreign agent and taking boatloads of sweet, sweet Turkish money.January 10, 2017Despite basically saying ""Don't hire me, I'm going to fuck this up,"" Flynn is hired and promptly sets about fucking this up. On January 10th, Flynn decides that the Obama administration's plans to work with Syrian Kurdish forces to fight ISIS by taking the city of Raqqa is crap. Trump is still 10 days from being president, but the Obama officials need his team to sign off on it. Flynn says no, delaying the operation and also supporting the position of Turkey, which is opposed to U.S. forces teaming with Syrian Kurds. Oh, also Turkey had paid Flynn $500,000 previously for his secret lobbyist job.January 20, 2017Intelligence officials warn Israel not to share sensitive info with Trump because it might get back to the Russians. Ha ha ha! Isn't that silly? How would info get from the president to the Russians? If this was a Choose Your Own Adventure novel, we'd ask you to move to May 10th, but it's not, so don't skip ahead yet!January 26, 2017Sally Yates goes to the White House to warn officials that Flynn could be open to blackmail by the Russians. Oh man! That's warning number two!February 13, 2017Flynn resigns as national security advisor. Or he's fired. Depends who you read. On the 13th? You bet on the 13th!February 14, 2017It's Valentine's Day, and love is in the air! According to memos written by James Comey, then-head of the FBI, Donald Trump urges him to drop the investigation into Flynn's ties to Russia. Word is Comey didn't feel comfortable with Trump, so he kept extensive notes on their interactions. According to his notes, Trump says ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go."" If that's true, many analysts have said it could amount to obstruction of justice and be grounds for impeachment. Trump probably never thought of that because he doesn't like peaches, only well-done steak.April 25, 2017Trump sends a text to Michael Flynn telling him to stay strong, according to Flynn. Because of course that happened.May 9, 2017President Trump fires Comey, the man leading the investigation into the his administration's alleged ties with Russia. The reason provided is that Comey bungled his handling of the Hillary Clinton email server (sure). Trump says he consulted with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russian investigation, as well as a letter drafted by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.May 10, 2017Around now is when the shitsnowball gets pushed off the top of the hill and shit starts accumulating fast. Trump has a meeting at the White House, in America, not as a joke, with Sergey Kislyak and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Never mind the widespread suspicion that Russia tried to influence the U.S. election in favor of Trump, they still got an invite. Who doesn't get an invite is American press, shunned in favor of the Russian media, which the White House claims was sheer trickery. They thought that Russian photographer was just doing glamour shots.At the meeting with the Russians, Trump decides to share classified intel about ISIS garnered from Israeli sources. Word is the info is so top-secret that even allies like Canada and the UK don't have it yet. But now Russia does! Neat-o.At this same meeting, Trump tells the Russians about firing Comey, referring to him as ""a real nut job."" He then goes on to explain that this will take the pressure off that pesky Russia thing and, as a garnish, tells them he's not being investigated.May 11, 2017In an interview with Lester Holt, Trump contradicts his earlier statement regarding the firing of Comey by stating, ""When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.'""May 16, 2017Trump goes on Twitter to explain sharing top-secret info with Russians. ""As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety.""Supporters are quick to point out that he's right. The president can declassify and share any info he wants whenever he wants. Critics point out that's kind of missing the issue, and everyone in the White House probably hurried to change their pin numbers and passwords, unless they wanted their nudes leaked to the Russians.Officials are worried that Trump's disclosure put the life of an operative working within ISIS in danger. Meanwhile, a bot campaign arises, quickly picked up by FOX news, which accuses Hillary Clinton of murdering former staffer Seth Rich.According to the story, a PI has evidence that Rich, who worked for Clinton's campaign, leaked info to WikiLeaks and was later murdered. The PI then says that's not true and that he'd heard it originally from a FOX reporter. Rich's family says it's not true and begs for a retraction, as there is no evidence from any law enforcement that Rich ever contacted WikiLeaks. Despite that, numerous just-made Twitter accounts which today are no longer active spread the story like creamy bullshit peanut butter until it went viral.Meanwhile, back at the ranch, all this news is apparently too much for House Republicans, who start turning on Trump and demanding to see and hear from Comey, as well as read whatever files he might have had pertaining to his investigation. Then again, none of them seem willing to impeach. In fact, John McCain says that talk of impeachment is not ""rational."" If he's ever engulfed in flames, he'll probably tell the firemen, ""Now don't be hasty.""May 17, 2017Ever-helpful Vladimir Putin says he has a transcript of the meeting between Trump and the Russian officials, which he's happy to share and will surely be trusted by everyone and isn't just Putin trolling hard as a mofo.Meanwhile back at the ranch again, former FBI director Robert Mueller is appointed special counsel in the Russia probe by Rod Rosenstein. Most people take this as a good thing. Maybe not Trump, but most people.Michael Flynn keeps things interesting by so far ignoring a subpoena. Waiting for a sweet deal? Who's to say? Maybe ask a Russian ...May 18, 2017Yeah, Trump definitely didn't like the Mueller thing. After special counsel is appointed, Trump says he's the victim of the greatest witch hunt in American political history and also says no politician has ever been treated worse than him. The internet explodes in guffaws and references to JFK, Lincoln, and Mandela. Others point out how he spent the better part of Obama's administration leading the birther brigade. But whatever, who has time for irony?May 19, 2017Trump takes off for a delightful trip abroad. At the same time, news breaks that Jared Kushner is being looked at as a ""person of interest"" in the Russia probe, and that investigators are now looking to see if White House officials have actively engaged in a cover-up.Can you believe this was all basically news from one week?

387,Why Trump's Tough-As-Nails Man Lawyer Is Undefeatable,http://www.cracked.com/blog/why-trumps-lawyer-manliest-man-that-ever-manned/,"FacebookTwitterAdd to FavoritesDonald Trump is bringing out the big guns to defend himself in the Russian situation which he assures us doesn't even exist. Trump's knight in shining armor is septuagenarian defense attorney John Dowd, who's like your grandpa if your grandpa was a pissed-off homunculus forged from every Alpha Beta in the 1987 classic Revenge Of The Nerds.Coming out of the gate running, or at least hobbling in a very determined manner, Dowd is described as an ex-marine who may or may not have served our country at Verdun. The first quote in this Reuters article is ""I fight hard,"" because that's what old men in suits in courtrooms do. He goes on to say ""this is war, and I will defeat you,"" like the villain of late-'90s RPG that didn't get translated into English so well. Suffice it to say, he seeks to crush his enemies and to hear the lamentations of their women, the latter of which he will do pro bono.Dowd is 6'4"" tall, a fact we know because the article says so while never explaining why you need to know that about a lawyer. They use words like ""no-holds barred"" and ""attack"" when describing how he works. Again, as a lawyer. Have you ever been to court? Even Law & Order could, at its coolest, only give us Sam Waterston. That's the best fiction can offer. Real-life court is as action-packed as falling asleep on the toilet. Or it was, until Dowd got on the scene with his brutal mix of jurisprudence and courtroom capoeira. Oh, did you have an objection? Well get ready to sustain a broken spine, you crap-shack of a human. You just went Dowd for the count!Dowd has accused reporters of whoring for the prosecution, and has given them the finger. The finger! Probably the middle one, because this pissed-off grandpa isn't taking any goddamn sass from shitheel reporters. Fuck no. He's heading into the courtroom wearing a King-Kong-Bundy-style one-shoulder-strap unitard, and he'll boot-fuck justice right down James Comey's throat before suplexing Robert Mueller onto the shattered corpses of who the fuck knows, probably Obama and Hillary.Every day, John Dowd wakes up and tongue-fucks Lady Liberty 'til she's good and swoony, then picks up 50 lbs of justice in an Old-Glory-themed tote bag from the White House gift shop, before doing 1,000 reps on each arm until he's so vascular you can see the red, white, and blood nectar rushing through his veins.via Business Insider""YOU WANNA THROW DOWD?! YOU WANNA THROW DOWD?!""John Dowd wears finely cut suits made from the flesh of asshole prosecutors who dared make eye contact with him and were vaporized on the spot by his fiery legalese. ""This is war, and I will defeat you!"" Why anyone dares step into a courtroom with Dowd has been studied for over 50 years by anthropologists, and they're no closer to achieving any sort of logical understanding. John Dowd fucks his opponents so hard that their mothers can't even sit down properly for the next day and a half. He's 6'4"", motherfucker! Have you ever stacked white-hot justice that high without having it punch a hole straight through your sternum so it could wear you as a goddamn hat? Fuck no! FUUUUCCCKKKK NOOOO!!!John Dowd dares anyone to even think the word ""Russia"" within three blocks of him. If his spider sense gets to tingling, if you even have a drink poured made from vodka, he will fucking windsprint like a PCP-addled gibbon through traffic, crowds, and goddamn windows to hurl you like a pagan sacrifice into the roiling pits of his justice volcano. This is not a goddamn game. THIS. IS. WAR.Emory Law""I law like I fuck: HARD.""""I am not a snowflake, I can tell you that,"" says Dowd, possibly while feasting directly from the inside of a grizzly bear he strangled with his own dick. The article briefly degrades into talk of actual court-type stuff, but it is only meant to lull you into a false sense of security before we get back to Michael Bay Presents: Lawyer, as Dowd and the writer continue to hammer home the idea that this is not a 76-year-old man who should, statistically speaking, be dead, but a goddamn unstoppable force of nature. They say he'll be a ""ferocious defender of the President,"" because he literally ate that bear's soul and gained its powers! Six foot fucking four inches! You know how tall James Comey is? Six feet under, bitches!Is it necessary that this old, old, old man be presented as what would happen if Rambo and Clarence Darrow had a baby? Yes. Because too many action heroes these days are based on Marvel Comics. What the hell is an Iron Man? That shit isn't real. What is real is Grampy Dowd and his tough-as-nails approach to habeas corpus.Expect to see Dowd in court ripping his shirt off and putting every Democrat within Camel Clutch range into the throes of pain and humiliation, because that is how good lawyering is done. Fuckin' research? Well-thought arguments? Precedent? Goddamn evidence? Do you even law, bro? Have you made any sweet legal gains? WHY DON'T YOU EAT SOME MORE OF THESE STRAINED PEAS, YOU FUCKING NANCY BABY? WHY DON'T YOU DIE IN A HOUSE FIRE TO PRESERVE A SHRED OF YOUR DIGNITY? GGGRAAAGHHHH!!!! LAAAAAAAWWWWWW!!!!!John Dowd. Remember the name, nerds. He's coming, and justice is coming with him.",0
388,United States to build wall around D.C.,http://thedailyer.com/united-states-build-wall-around-d-c/,"In reaction to a long, arduous election cycle filled with finger-pointing, scandals, and plenty of drinking as a coping mechanism, the 50 states wasted no time in deciding to erect a wall around Washington, D.C.The project started simply as a joke Facebook event created by 19-year-old Pennsylvania resident Zoey Mattigano, but quickly garnered attention nationwide, with 10.3 million Facebook users RSVPing to the event at press time.âI was just trying to make light of this situation at first, but I guess people really liked the idea and took it seriously. A statesâ rights organization contacted me and asked if they could take over the event and start organizing the construction of an actual wall,â Mattigano told The DailyER. âI told them, âYeah sure lolâ and they just went hard at it.âThe organization, known as The Statesâ Congress, had actually begun planning prior to permissions from Mattigano to take control of the event page.âWe were just so excited and surprised that nobody had thought of this idea before,â Statesâ Congress member and wall architect Donavan St. Germain said.St. Germain briefly went into the details of the proposed wall, stating that building around the 40-mile perimeter of Washington, D.C. will be much cheaper and more easily monitored than the roughly 2,000-mile-long U.S.-Mexico border wall proposed by President-Elect Donald Trump.âSince the length will be 50 times shorter than what is proposed by Trump, we can make it higher and add more bells and whistles to it and still make it affordable,â St. Germain said. âElon Musk reached out to us and said he wanted to contribute an experimental laser defense system in case any U.S. Congressmen or lobbyists try to escape. Plus, this way we can make sure Trump doesnât go and embarrass the nation on international trips. We also plan on installing Internet jammers along the wall.âIt looks like America can unify behind a single cause after all.",0
389,Trump Wants His Limo To Be Bigger Than Obamaâs,http://bizstandardnews.com/2017/09/11/trump-wants-limo-bigger-obamas/,"President Donald Trump seems to have an obsession with size. During the presidential campaign he bragged about the size of his hands and manhood. And he also claimed his inauguration crowds were bigger that President Barack Obama. He also griped about the size of his plane. âThe president, though, had one gripe, after his visit from the emir of Kuwait on Thursday afternoon. He was very impressed by the emirâs plane but noted that it was longer than his â maybe even by 100 feet,â according to Politico. That hasnât gone away, according to White House leaker âOrange Throat.â The Business Standard News received an email that claimed Trump wanted to increase the length of âThe Beast,â the presidential limo. âTrump is obsessed with trying to do everything better than Obama,â said Orange Throat. âHe wanted to make the Beast a few inches longer so he could say his was bigger than Obamaâs.â Several White House staffer have admitted the only reason they stay is to stop Trump from carrying out in even crazier plans.",0
390,Trump Wants A Big Military Parade Down Pennsylvania Avenue,https://crooksandliars.com/2017/09/trump-wants-big-military-parade-down,"So Donald Trump thinks it would be a great idea to have a military parade down Pennsylvania Avenue for the Fourth of July.Let me guess: Mexico is gonna pay for it. New York Times:President Trump said on Monday that he was looking into staging a display of American military might in a Fourth of July parade down Pennsylvania Avenue.In remarks during a meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France at the United Nations, Mr. Trump said he got the idea after watching the Bastille Day parade in Paris with Mr. Macron in July. During the parade, he could be seen gesticulating and whispering to Mr. Macron at the elaborate display of tanks, soldiers on horseback and military jets flying overhead.âI came back and one of my early calls were, I think we are going to have to start looking at that ourselves,â the president told Mr. Macron. âWe are actually thinking about Fourth of July, Pennsylvania Avenue, having a really great parade to show our military strength.âLou Dobbs and the Fox News retired white general of the day Jack Keane think it's a ""grand idea.""Dobbs tweeted: ""Bring Back Our Parades!""The ""our"" is right-wing jingoists who love the military but don't enlist. In fact, it's kind of amazing how many right wing tv personalities and thought-leaders wouldn't be able to march in a US military parade:Lou Dobbs: Did not serveBill Bennett: Did not servePat Buchanan: Did not servePaul Gigot: Did not serveSean Hannity: Did not serveBill Kristol: Did not serveRush Limbaugh: Did not serveMichael Medved: Did not serveTed Nugent: Did not serveBill O'Reilly: Did not serveRalph Reed: Did not serveMichael Savage: Did not serveClarence Thomas: Did not serveGeorge Will: Did not serveDonald Trump....yep, Did not serve.But they love a parade that affirms their politics but not their lives.And they love a military where they can cheer but not interrupt their career path.What a bunch of hypocrites.",0

Photo credit: Jaylene Ebbs.âMy decades being a neurosurgeon taught me that there are no challenges in life that we cannot overcome with serene thought and prayer,â a visibly relieved Carson said as he hugged strangers and reporters alike.Low-cost housing tenants protesting against Dr. Carsonâs push to implement Donald Trumpâs $62 billion cut to housing assistance say the escalator made a squealing noise before slowly coming to a stop, leaving Carson standing about 2/3 of the way up.âHe looked up at all of us waiting for him on the second level but he just stood there,â said one onlooker.âDidnât move a step even though we were all telling him to just â you know â walk up the stairs. Weird stuff, gotta say.âNBC 6 Miami reporter Alina Machado finally went down the stairs and convinced Carson he didnât have to wait for the escalator to be repaired and then was able to lead him to the top by the elbow.âIâm not certain what was going through Secretary Carsonâs mind that made him believe he was stuck on the escalator. Nope. I have no idea whatsoever,â Machado said in her news bulletin afterwards.âDr. Carson became a bit emotional when he stepped off the stalled escalator. We were all very confused.âCarson (65) has often referred to himself as a âcloud personâ, a term he has never clearly defined when pressed by media or even colleagues. The New York Times has frequently used the term âatypical thinkerâ to describe Carson after interviews where he has offered opinions on everything ranging slaves having been immigrants to the pyramids being built to store grain and brew whiskey.âWhen things happen on the outside, we need to listen to our insideâs outside and outsideâs inside,â Carson told the small, confused crowd before wandering off in the direction of the mallâs food court.Secretary Carsonâs communications aide was unable to clarify this comment for reporters.William YumReportering for The Lapine",0

These crowâs feet?  This is what all the fake news about Russia and Putin is doing to me! I have crowâs feet! And my hair has totally lost its bounce and sheen!â Kushner said emotionally before pointing out the bags under his mahogany eyes.âThe pressure is constant and Iâm seeing its horrible affects on me in the mirror 20 or 30 times a day,â said Kushner.Portrait of Jared Corey Kushner hanging in greeting room of Ivanka and Jared Kushnerâs Washington home.

Boyish looks aside, I am totally focused on fixing everything thatâs wrong. Fixing. Every. Single. Thing,â he said.âWhat CNN, the New York Times and Hillary Clinton are doing should be illegal!

The announcement received immediate accolades from an array of Hollywood celebrities who supported Hillary Clinton for president.Alec Baldwin Tweeted that the special Emmy  was âa necessary and important recognition of a woman who has accomplished a whole lot of stuff.âChelsea Handler was unable to express her elation as she wept uncontrollably in the comforting arms of California Senator Barbara Boxer during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.In an interview with Chris Matthews on MSNBC this afternoon, Chelsea Clinton shared her feelings about the honor. Following is a transcript of their conversation that will air tomorrow night at 6:00pm on MSNBC.CHRIS MATTHEWS: While Donald Trump was in France avoiding impeachment calls here at home, Chelsea Clinton discovered she is going to be honored at this yearâs Emmys with an honorary Lifetime Achievement Award. Sheâs in the studio with me tonight. Letâs play Hardball!(Show theme song plays)CHRIS MATTHEWS: Iâm excited to welcome my first guest tonight, Chelsea Clinton. Daughter of former President Bill Clinton and former first lady, senator, secretary of state and two time presidential loser, Hillary Clinton. Chelsea, thank you for coming.CHELSEA CLINTON: Thank you, Chris. Itâs a pleasure to be here. And just for the record, mom may have lost the delegate count but she received over 3 million more popular votes than Donald Trump.CHRIS MATTHEWS: That is true, but it has nothing to do with how our elections work. She was unfortunately defeated fair and square by Donald Trump eight years after getting shellacked by Barack Obama. Now, letâs talk about you. Tell me, what did you think when you heard you were getting an Emmy Award? Must have been exhilarating.CHELSEA: Yes, it was so exciting. My children and I were reading The Canterbury Tales together when my mom called and broke the news. She was so happy for me.CHRIS MATTHEWS: How did your dad react?CHELSEA: Dad has been on a fishing expedition on a secluded island in the Caribbean for the past week. I havenât spoken with him yet.CHRIS MATTHEWS: Oh god â¦ please tell me heâs not hanging out with billionaire pedophile Jeffery Epstein again.CHELSEA: Heâs fishing with some family friends, Chris.CHRIS MATTHEWS: What was the nickname for Epsteinâs tawdry island of debauchery? Orgy Island! So disgusting. Anyway, letâs hope that President Clinton has put all that nonsense behind him. So have you thought about what youâre going to say when you accept your Emmy?CHELSEA: Well, the awards arenât until September so I have some time to think it through.CHRIS MATTHEWS: Iâll bet youâre gonna pay tribute to your mom, huh?CHELSEA: Of course I will acknowledge mom, but this is my award. I will probably focus on the important and crucial work that I do with everything from breastfeeding and diarrhea to gender pronoun options.CHRIS MATTHEWS: But your mom was just humiliated in one of the more remarkable elections in the history of our country. Surely you will have some comforting words for the millions of voters who were so heartbroken with her embarrassing defeat.CHELSEA: I think voters have accepted that even though mom won more popular votes than Donald Trump they are stuck with him.CHRIS MATTHEWS: There have been stories about your mom wandering aimlessly in the woods. Is that her way of avoiding your father?CHELSEA: Why would she avoid my father?CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, he might be vacationing on Orgy Island now, but at some point heâs going to come back home. And itâs not like your mom has anything to occupy her time with. I guess what Iâm asking is, after all the years of what everybody assumes is an acrimonious relationship, can your parents endure residing in the close proximity they now find themselves in?CHELSEA: My mom and dad love each other and cherish the moments they have together.CHRIS MATTHEWS: Do you know what youâre going to wear at the Emmys?CHELSEA: I have been so busy working to make the world a better place that I havenât even thought about that, Chris.CHRIS MATTHEWS: I read somewhere that your mom called you selfless. Are you selfless, Chelsea?CHELSEA: I donât think of myself as selfless. I do sacrifice the majority of my time bettering the lives of millions of people around the world, but thatâs probably due to my baptist upbringing. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self, Chris.CHRIS MATTHEWS: Uh huh. Tell me, did your dad ever have relations with a woman of color?CHELSEA: I assume you are talking about working relationships. Yes, he has and still does have rewarding working relationships with many women of color.CHRIS MATTHEWS: During the second presidential debate with your mom, Donald Trump brought along three women who for years have claimed your dad sexually assaulted or harassed them. But being victims of sexual misconduct wasnât the only thing those women had in common.CHELSEA: What are you talking about?CHRIS MATTHEWS: They were all white women. Not one woman of color. That bothered me at first. But then I realized â¦CHELSEA: Realized what?CHRIS MATTHEWS: I realized how much respect your dad has always had for women of color. The first black president wasnât going to sexually abuse his own kind. I have no doubt that you are very proud of that.CHELSEA: I, uh â¦CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well look at that â¦ weâre out of time. Congratulations on your Emmy award Chelsea. And please, give my best to your mom. I can only imagine how deep her devastation must still be. Hopefully your Emmy award will help brighten her dark days.CHELSEA: Thatâs it? But we didnât talk about my book!CHRIS MATTHEWS: (Looking into camera) Coming up next, two men who went to high school with Donald Trump Jr. allege he once said he had to piss like a Russian race horse.

Speaking to U.N. delegates at the One World Economic Forum, Gore said the cumulative effects of drought, famine, global civil wars and eroding national monuments will spark what scientists call âhomocranialcombustibleâ â or in laymanâs terms, exploding human heads.âThe calamitous effects of global warming will soon begin making peopleâs heads explode,â Gore told reporters afterward. âThe scientific community has yet to discover exactly how this is going to happen but make no mistake, regardless of what the deniers say, itâs going to happen unless we act.âAfter the announcement Gore boarded a private helicopter that transported him to South Hampton, Long Island where he lunched with Barbra Streisand, Dan Rather and Jerry Springer. A few hours later he helicoptered back to mid-town Manhattan where he spoke with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC.RACHEL MADDOW:  I want to welcome to my show the former vice president, former senator, Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Oscar and Grammy winner and NY Times best selling author, Al Gore.AL GORE: (touching his heart) A pleasure to be with you, Rachel.RACHEL MADDOW:  Thatâs a heck of a resume.AL GORE: Oh gosh, Iâm not any better than the insignificant guy on the street, Rachel.RACHEL MADDOW:  Mr. Vice President, is it true?AL GORE:  That Iâm single, wealthy and available?Thedailyrash.comRACHEL MADDOW:  No, that peopleâs heads are going to start exploding if we donât act now on global warming.AL GORE:  Unfortunately, Rachel, itâs true. If we donât act immediately the world will be engulfed in exploding heads along with the expected famine, World War III and higher intensity allergy symptoms.RACHEL MADDOW:  But why are our heads going to explode, Mr. Vice President?AL GORE:  Oh, Rachel, itâs such a convoluted mixture of everything from CO2 and carbon to industrial waste and bovine flatulence. It would take me weeks to decipher the scientific theorems in a way that you might per chance be able to understand.RACHEL MADDOW:  What can I do to ensure my head wonât explode?AL GORE:  Rachel, unless we raise the trillions of dollars thatâs needed to combat this deadly and horrific symptom of climate change, thereâs nothing you can do.RACHEL MADDOW:  Thatâs just horrible, Mr. Vice President.AL GORE:  Donât you know it.RACHEL MADDOW: (digging around in her purse) Could I give you some money right now? To do my part?AL GORE: (whips out a duffel bag) Of course Rachel. And I sure hope everyone on your staff can give me their money too.(MSNBC staff members crowd around Al Gore throwing money into his duffel bag)Thedailyrash.comRACHEL MADDOW:  (Into TV camera) I want everyone watching to dig deep into your wallets, look for coins in the cushions of your couch, anything. If you wonât do it to keep your own head from exploding, do it for your child, your aging parents or frightened transgenders who donât want to die.AL GORE: (Grimacing as he tries to squeeze the full duffel bag closed) Rachel, I want to thank you and your staff for this money and I want to remind your audience to give. (looks into camera) Because if we donât immediately raise the money we need, your head is going to explode. I want all you parents out there to think about this: Whatâs it going to do to the psyche of your little child when one minute theyâre sitting at the dinner table picking at their green beans, and the next minute theyâre wiping the brains of their mother off their little face?RACHEL MADDOW:  (gasping) Itâs just too awful to think about, President Gore.AL GORE:  (Still struggling to close overstuffed duffel bag) It sure is, Rachel.After having lunch at a Beverly Hills restaurant with George Clooney and Oprah, President Obama spoke to reporters about the devastating climate change news as he played Go Fish with Rev. Al Sharpton on board Air Force One.âDonât listen to the deniers,â the president warned. âThe science is settled. There is no doubt whatsoever in the minds of the worldâs greatest climate change experts that human heads will begin spontaneously exploding if we donât spend trillions of dollars to battle the horrific consequences of man made global warming.âA reporter asked if the president was worried about his daughters.âOh sure.

A former spokesperson for the Ron Paul for President committee fervently denies the candidate distributed LSD.âRepresentative Paul was not at the Occupy Wall Street protests so how could he have been dispensing LSD to those people?âYet several protesters claim that Ron Paul not only gave them LSD, but encouraged them to build nuclear weapons at home in their spare time.âThat Ron Paul guy was really cool,â proclaimed former Columbia University student Dylan Baez Shwartzkoff. âDude gave me and my girlfriend some awesome acid and said if we voted for him heâd decriminalize drugs and make them available in schools along with condoms and small firearms.âOther protesters allege Paul told them his administration would not punish anyone for having a nuclear weapon.Thedailyrash.comâYeah, that dude was pretty radical,â exclaimed protester Nirvana Tweedsdale. âHe turned me and my friends on to some awesome LSD and then hung out with us. Mr. Ron gave us pamphlets about constitutional freedoms and surviving nuclear fallout. At one point after the acid had kicked in, Mr. Ron leaned in and whispered: âhow would you like to have an atom bomb of your very own?â I must have been tripping pretty heavy at that point because when I looked at him there was a tiny naked man draped around his shoulders gnawing on a candy apple.âMany protesters who tripped on Ron Paulâs LSD said they experienced hallucinations about President Obama.Thedailyrash.comSkip Boyle, Indianapolis â âI saw President Obama sitting on top of a van weeping openly, clutching a tear soaked towel. Then Cloris Leachman flew over me on a big black bird. She had bright blue lips and was shrieking Ron Paul! Ron Paul! down at the crowd.

Ron Paul! echoed faintly from the heavens.âChristin Hemmens, Chicago â âI saw President Obama up to his neck in a big stack of pancakes. There was an enormous pat of butter on top of his head.

398,White House Says Trump in âFrequentâ Contact with Extraterrestrials,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/09/white-house-says-trump-in-frequent-contact-with-extraterrestrials/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. â Since assuming office on January 20, 2017, President Donald J. Trump has periodically exchanged messages with intelligent extraterrestrial life forms who, according to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, have provided him with advice and guidance on a multitude of issues ranging from job creation to national security. âThey know heâs an excellent negotiator â probably the best our planet has to offer â and thatâs why theyâve elected to speak with him,â Secretary Sanders told a handful of reporters during an off-camera briefing on Wednesday. While Sanders could not comment on the extent or frequency of the encounters, she said President Trump is âextremely humbledâ to be the first head of state to make contact with alien life. While senior White House officials and even Trumpâs immediate family are reportedly barred from attending meetings between the president and his extraterrestrial advisers, sources close to Mr. Trump say the president has hinted that heâs negotiating a deal with the aliens that will make America âbetter than anyone ever thought possible.â However, due to the secrecy surrounding President Trumpâs private encounters with the extraterrestrials, the terms and precise nature of the deal remain unclear. During an interview with Fox News host Shepard Smith, President Trumpâs longtime friend and dentist, Dr. Charles H. Brister, DDS, said the president believes he was chosen by the aliens for a reason. âAt our last session, [the president] told me how grateful he is to have these beings in his corner, particularly considering how unfairly heâs been treated by the media,â Dr. Brister said, adding, âHeâs the only one capable of doing this and he knows it. Thatâs why the American people elected him.â In a statement released Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that, despite the implications, President Donald J. Trump has not yet met face-to-face with the allegedly intelligent beings. As to whether Mr. Trump will have his own close encounter of the third kind is, according to the White House, âbetween the president and his ET counterparts.â",0

Witnesses say the former Democratic presidential nominee appeared to lose consciousness moments after signing the 1,000th copy of What Happened for a loyal fan. âShe stood up like she was about to say something and then she kind of staggered backwards before falling face first into a chest-high stack of books,â Maria Rodriguez, a lifelong Clinton supporter and mother of six, told The New York Times. Clinton, whose bestselling account of why she lost the 2016 presidential election to former reality TV star and billionaire entrepreneur Donald J. Trump has sold more copies in its first week than The Art of the Deal sold in a year, is said to be recovering at Manhattanâs Mount Sinai Hospital. âMrs. Clinton suffered some minor bruising but we expect her to make a full recovery,â Mount Sinaiâs chief medical officer, Dr. Ben Sheldon, told reporters on Thursday. âRest assured, sheâll be back to signing books in no time.â Sources close to Clinton say that despite her injuries, the former Secretary of State is âreadier than everâ to get on with her book tour. âShe let her self go a little too hard today,â Clintonâs longtime friend and publicist, Jacob Knot, told Real News Right Now, adding, âIt just goes to show how devoted she is to the American people.â In just over a week since its release, What Happened has quickly become the most talked-about publication in American history with tens of thousands turning out daily to catch a glimpse of the former First Lady turned bestselling author. âSheâs a total rock star,â said Lee Irving, who, along with hundreds of other ecstatic fans, has attended book signings in multiple states. âWhen you look at the size of these crowds itâs more than obvious how she won the popular vote.â",0

Trump, in an appearance on Fox News this week, accused a CNN news crew of stealing his wallet during his 2020 presidential campaign rally in Florida last Saturday. âLet me tell you, these people are very dishonest,â the President told Shepard Smith on Tuesday. âThey came to me asking for a soundbite and the next thing â the next thing you know, my wallet is gone.â President Trump described the wallet as a brown leather passcase from his own Signature Collection and said at the time of the theft he was carrying it in the right pocket of his sports coat. âThese people have their own agenda; they canât be trusted. You look at CNN and the fake stories they put out, itâs sick what these people will do for ratings,â Trump charged before adding that the Secret Service is spearheading an investigation into the incident. While refusing to elaborate on the nature of the investigation, President Trump told Fox News he has ordered Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy to personally lead the inquiry into his walletâs whereabouts. âBelieve me, this is very, very serious and weâre going to get to the bottom of it,â Trump vowed. âYouâre going to start hearing things very soon.â The President went on to say that at the time of the alleged theft, the contents of his wallet included a billfold of approximately five thousand dollars in hundred-dollar bills and a copy of the nuclear launch codes. Sources close to President Trump say he rarely ventures out without his Donald J. Trump Signature Collection passcase wallet. Designed for the discerning entrepreneur, the leather wallet features an emboldened gold logo and comes equipped with a bill compartment, three credit card pockets, and ample storage space. A presidential profile piece published by The New York Times on Wednesday provided a brief description of the high-end wallet, saying it contained âa pocket-sized photograph of Russian president Vladimir Putin and no cash.â Since assuming office just over a month ago, Mr. Trump has embroiled himself in a seemingly endless war with the mainstream media. In a February 17 tweet, the President of the United States announced, âThe FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!â During Saturdayâs rally at Orlando Melbourne International Airport, Trump doubled down on attacking the âdishonest media,â telling a crowd of 9,000 enthusiastic supporters that he would âspeak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.â",0

Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday directing the Department of Justice to revoke all sixteen Thanksgiving Day turkey pardons issued by the former president during his eight years in office. âAfter reviewing the decisions made by the previous administration, President Trump has determined that a number of turkey pardons issued by Barack Obama were done so in a manner that was both deceitful and hazardous to the American people,â White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced on Tuesday. âThis morning, the president once again used his executive powers to see to it that justice is served and that the surviving creatures will be destroyed.â Spicer said very little is known about the true origins of the sixteen turkeys or why they were specifically singled out by former President Barack Obama. âThere are a lot of obvious questions we just donât have the answers to. Were they connected to radical Islamic terrorism? Black Lives Matter extremists? We canât be sure,â he said. âAll we know is they were sentenced to death and Obama took it upon himself to meddle in the independent judicial process.â Of the sixteen turkeys pardoned by Obama, all but five are deceased. âThese birds, despite their deaths, will have their pardons revoked posthumously during a ceremony in the Rose Garden,â Secretary Spicer explained. The remaining birds â Tater, Tot, Abe, Honest, and Cheese â are scheduled to be remanded into federal custody on Friday before they are turned over to officials from the Federal Bureau of Prisons who are under orders to execute the turkeys by firing squad. The annual Thanksgiving Day turkey pardon dates back to 1863 when President Abraham Lincoln first granted clemency to his sonâs beloved pet turkey which the First Family had intended to feast on for Thanksgiving dinner.",0

Chuck Grassley Opens Corruption Investigation Into Hillary Clinton,http://dailyheadlines.net/2017/06/sen-chuck-grassley-opens-corruption-investigation-into-hillary-clinton/,"The democrats are about to pay for their false Trump/Russia narrative.  Democrats know there is no there there, but want their voters to think otherwise.  And theyâre right.  59% of democrats believe that Russia actually changed the votes in order for Trump to win.  This just proves they are utter morons because voting machines arenât connected to the internet.Sen Chuck Grassley on the other hand is going after Hillary for corruption and black mail.  Witnesses who actually allow their names to be used have already gone public with Clintonâs scheme to save a donor to the Clinton Foundation from prison for embezzlement.Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley has started an investigation into whether Hillary Clinton acted to prevent a Bangladeshi probe into a Clinton Foundation donor, The Daily Caller reports.Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to the State Department requesting information regarding possible interference into a corruption investigation into Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi banker and economist who is also a close friend of the Clintons.In May, The Daily Caller reported that during her time at the State Department, Clinton had put pressure on Bangladesh to stop a probe into Yunus and Grameen Bank. The son of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina even told The Daily Caller he had been threatened with an IRS audit if the investigation was not dropped.âAs I wrote in my August 2016 letter to Department of Justice, federal law requires that executive branch employees be disqualified from matters that have a direct and predictable effect on the employeeâs own financial interests or the financial interests of those persons or organizations with which the employee is affiliated, such as those of a spouse, unless the employee first obtains an individual waiver or a regulatory exemption applies,â Grassley said in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.âOnce again, Secretary Clintonâs actions have raised reasonable suspicions that she violated these rules and undermined the publicâs confidence in the integrity of the State Department.ââIf the Secretary of State used her position to intervene in an independent investigation by a sovereign government simply because of a personal and financial relationship stemming from the Clinton Foundation rather than the legitimate foreign policy interests of the United States, then that would be unacceptable,â he added.âCo-mingling her official position as Secretary of State with her family foundation would be similarly inappropriate. It is vital to determine whether the State Department had any role in the threat of an IRS audit against the son of the Prime Minister in retaliation for this investigation.âIf Grassley continues his look into the Grameen Bank affair, it would be the first major post-election congressional inquiry into either the Democrat presidential nominee or the Clinton Foundation.",0

408,Ohio Gov. John Kasich Legalizes Exhumation of Confederate Soldiers Statewide,https://www.delawareohionews.com/national-news/ohio-governor-kasich-exhuming-confederate-soldiers/,"By Ricardo Paye 69784 69A small Ohio town that exhumed the bodies of Confederate soldiers and discarded their remains in a dirty lake has inspired Ohio Governor John Kasich to enact legislation allowing other cemeteries to do the same. He signed an executive order this morning waiving the protections granted to the graves and memorials of Confederate veterans in the state.Speaking out against Confederate monumentsâWe owe a great deal of gratitude to history and the brave men and women who have fought and died to make this great country what it is today,â read a statement released by the governorâs office. âHowever, we are a divided people. Gone is the nation that looked past its racist, violent history in favor of that warm tale where everyone was equal and the future was bright.ââConfederate monuments in public spaces are nothing more than grotesque reminders of the fake news that once threatened our great republic, and which threatens us again today. Letâs leave memories of the Confederacy where they belong â on the internet â and reclaim this great land for more righteous mistakes and tragedies yet to come,â the statement concluded.A state governor supporting the desecration of veteran graves is a highly controversial escalation in the nationwide debate over the place Confederate statues and memorials have in contemporary American society. A white nationalist rally that turned violent in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 12th brought renewed attention to the divisive issue and led cities across the country to remove Confederate monuments.Kasich positioning for 2020 presidential bidBeyond inflaming an already sensitive debate, Kasichâs decision to support removal of confederate memorials while also embracing the concept of âfake newsâ is a clear political maneuver aimed at drawing support from Trump opponents while also chipping away at the presidentâs base, which stood by him last week when he questioned whether removing confederate monuments has gone too far.âThis is Governor Kasich preparing for the 2020 presidential election,â said Ohio Republican Strategist Dennis Lovell. âHe doesnât care about dusty Confederate grave sites. Allowing cemeteries to dig up and sexually molest the remains of confederate soldiers is clearly a polarizing move, sure, but the governor is banking on the majority of Americans favoring unity and being done with Trump come the next election, and he wants to be remembered as a leader willing to take the radical steps necessary to bring this country back together.âActivists take bizarre liberties with Confederate corpsesIn Delaware, Ohio, where the controversial â#exhumeconfederatesâ grave digging movement started last week when government officials sanctioned the exhumation of Confederate soldiers, itâs been reported that the skeletal remains of several bodies were used as props in public sex acts performed by a group of ANTIFA protesters camping on the property.Kasichâs order ensures cemeteries wonât face legal repercussions for exhuming confederate remains, but says nothing about how the bodies must be handled or discarded, opening the door to more bizarre forms of desecration.Joseph Diggins, an employee at the cemetery, was tasked with exhuming some of the bodies and corroborated a number of troubling reports.âWe were trying to dig everyone up and get them dumped in the lake without drawing much attention, but the anti-Trump crowd picked up our scent from their tents and rushed over to snatch a couple of the caskets,â Diggins explained. âThe remains were obviously fragile and that led one group to crush a skull on the pavement and smoke the powder out of crystal meth pipe they were passing around.âTrump, Kasich have opposing views on desecration of Confederate gravesGovernor Kasich has not commented on the troubling reports or offered a strategy for preventing further depravity as hundreds of state cemeteries begin exhuming their Confederate dead.The governor has spoken out against Trumpâs position, however, tweeting he was âdisappointedâ by the Phoenix speech where the president condemned those digging up dead bodies.Trump asked Americanâs to stop disturbing Confederate grave sites.âFolks, our Confederate soldiers should remain buried in the ground, OK? Government officials, protesters, whoever â they shouldnât be mining Confederate bone dust or molesting corpses. Leave the bones alone. Thatâs what Iâm telling everyone. I speak to a lot of important people, and I say, âLeave the bones alone,ââ said Trump at the rally. âThey fought for America. They were buried in some of Americaâs finest coffins, by the way â wood that was actually luxurious for a dead body, not those cheap egg carton coffins Chinaâs making today â and now, what, weâre digging them up and wasting all that wood? I could probably build one of the finest properties in the world with that wood â maybe a little steel, too; Iâd need maybe a little, maybe a little â but no, no, these people? No values. No business sense. They probably wonât even sell the uniforms. Iâd sell the uniforms. I donât know. It has to stop.âThe president also took his concerns to Twitter the following day, speaking out against Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz), who he called âweak on grave digging.â There was no response to Governor Kasichâs criticisms or plans for executive action.President Donald Trump's tweet on grave diggingBoth sides brace for extended grassroots protestsWhile the political maneuvering continues, right wing activists and white nationalists are preparing to mobilize across the state of Ohio, hoping to halt or at least slow down the destruction of confederate corpses.âIt goes without saying that desecrating veteran graves is taking things a little too far,â said Ruth Ballman, the leader of Ohio white nationalist group The Pink Panthers. âIf our Republican governor thinks he can turn his back on his people like this and not find a thousand rotting slave corpses hanging at the statehouse, he has another thing coming. Weâre ready to dig our way back to the 19th century if thatâs what this governor wants.âOn the left, ANTIFA gypsies admitted theyâre mostly looking forward to the increase in Confederate bone powder, which is believed by many to be a mind-altering substance that intensifies ones positions on racism, morality, history, and reality.âWeâre going to snort these bones up and probably just kill each other,â said a leftist activist camping out at one Columbus cemetery. âFuck it.âPhotos courtesy of Global Reactions, heyitschili and Gage Skidmore on Flickr",0

Hundreds of negative reviews and the #SolarGate hashtag emerged on social media this week after the barâs owner, Ron Limpledick, allegedly directed racist and homophobic remarks toward a customer.Limpledick denies the claims and says the decision to become a gay bar proves he isnât prejudiced.âGays, slants, spooks â I love everybody,â Limpledick said. âIâm re-opening the Saloon as a gay bar so that thereâs a safe, inclusive place for all of these outcasts to gather regardless of their inferior race or sexual orientation.âAccording to reviews and reports from those at the bar the night of the incident, Limpledick called an African American customer a âFancy nigger fuck boyâ after the man ordered a Gin and Tonic.âIt was strange,â said Jan Marvula, who witnessed the interaction. âRacist and offensive, but said in kind of a sultry voice, like he was flirting. Beyond shivering a little bit and experiencing an intense urge to flee the establishment, I wasnât sure what to make of it.âLimpledick confirms he was sexually aroused but says the comment was taken out of context.âIt was a question,â Limpledick said. âI was asking him if he was gay. Iâm not, by the wayâyou know, not officiallyâbut if he were I was going to try selling him one of our new solar powered penis pumps.âLimpledick says more solar powered sex toys will be sold as part of the barâs transition.The alleged victim, Yung Custodian, said he forgives Limpledick and hopes he gets help.âHe once asked to photograph my dick on a solar panel and I said no because Iâm straight. Heâs been an asshole ever since,â Custodian said. âLast week he said he was working on a solar powered time machine that would take us back to 1808 where heâd make me work as his gay slave or some shit. I hope he finds Christ.â***UPDATE***To support the victim of this bigotry and interact with others exposed to pre-gay bar Solar Saloon, please join and follow the Dom Fisher Fan Club on Facebook. #domfisherfanclubImage courtesy of Steve Baker on Flickr",0
411,"6 Safe Places to Overdose on Heroin in Delaware, Ohio",https://www.delawareohionews.com/drugs-rec/safest-places-to-overdose-on-heroin-in-delaware-ohio/,"By Ricardo Paye 37700 17Letâs face it, thereâs nothing you can do about your heroin addiction. You can, however, limit the risk of death when you accidentally (and inevitably) overdose. One way to do that is to shoot up in safe, public places that are close to medical intervention but off law enforcementâs radar.This list, compiled by Delaware Ohio News in collaboration with local junkies, provides the 6 safest places to overdose in Delaware based on two safety factors: The likelihood of being saved and the likelihood of being arrested. Spots with low risk of arrest and high likelihood of medical intervention are the ones that topped our list.So, without further ado, letâs review the top 6 places to get smacked and narrowly avoid your untimely demise.6. The Blue Tube Slide at Mingo ParkTube Slide at Mingo Park in Delaware, OhioThe blue tube slide at Mingo Park is great because it provides a unique and even tranquil setting for mainlining your way into the dark abyss. Itâs safe because there will eventually be children trying to use the slide, meaning youâll be found sooner than later. The risk of arrest is lower here given law enforcementâs desire to avoid traumatizing kids and families more than they have to. Watching you foam at the mouth and come back to life among a swarm of first responders is enough for one day.5. Zion United Church of ChristZion United Church of Christ Delaware, OhioThis place of worship provides excellent cover for heroin addicts thanks to their community shelter. Church officials have said they expect heroin addicts to use the facility and staff the location with off duty police and paramedics. What better place to have your soul temporarily leave your body? You can briefly find God and then fall back to reality in the arms of His righteous servants before getting dope sick and chasing the dragon all over again.4. Anywhere in the Northwest NeighborhoodNorthwest Neighborhood in Delaware, OhioConsidered the heart of soul of Delaware, Ohio, the Northwest Neighborhood is a historic district that was home to city founders and entrepreneurs in the 1800s. Today, itâs a liberal and intellectual stronghold with a strong sense of community and a dense population of sympathetic families. Fiends can stumble their way through these tree lined streets and never be more than a few feet away from a warm, welcoming family just waiting to nurse them back to health and call 911. If cops associate you with the respectable neighborhood, theyâre more likely to let you off with a warning.3. Carlisle Elementary SchoolCarlisle Elementary School in Delaware, OhioOne could argue that any of Delawareâs five elementary schools would make good spots for drug overdoses, but none is safer than Carlisle. The school is close to Grady Memorial Hospital (#2 on our list) and has a comfortable recycling dumpster to rest against while you pump your veins full of skag from a dirty needle and doze off into oblivion. Dispose of your kit in the recycling bin prior to nodding off and youâll be safe from arrest.2. The Bus Stop at Grady Memorial HospitalBus Stop at Grady Memorial Hospital in Delaware, OhioThe bus stop at Grady Memorial Hospital is safe AND convenient. The local transit authority stop provides reliable transportation and the close proximity to the hospital ensures youâre only a few feet away from help when you overdose and begin seizing for your life.1. The Gazebo at Bicentennial Park (Behind the Fire Station)Bicentennial Park and Wilbur Bills Fire Station in Delaware, OhioTopping our list is the shaded Gazebo at Bicentennial Park, conveniently located directly behind the main fire station in the City of Delaware. This spot is perfect for obvious reasons. Itâs discreet enough to remain hidden from plain view of the surrounding roadways and Wesleyan campus; it provides a peaceful seating area with cover from the elements; and itâs right next to the people who will save your life when you take it too far and almost kill yourself.Itâs so close, in fact, that itâs rumored a paramedic once used a blowgun to shoot a Narcan dart over 100 yards, striking and reviving an overdose victim without even leaving the station.So there you have it: The safest places to overdose in Delaware, Ohio. Share with the addict in your life and do your part to help prolong their death.",0

413,Trumpâs Health Deteriorates as White House Pressures Mount,https://www.ncscooper.com/trumps-health-deteriorates-as-white-house-pressures-mount/,"Washington, D.C. â Washington insiders and health officials close to Donald Trump have raised concerns that the 45th President is showing signs of aggressive aging after only being office for 152 days, 8 hours, 9 minutes and 7 seconds. According to more than one White House aide, all of whom chose to remain anonymous, the 71-year-old leader of the free world has dramatically aged at a breathtaking pace. There are concerns about Trumpâs health as the pressures of the presidency take their toll on him. âWhen he took office, letâs be honest, he was no spring chicken,â said one White House insider who spoke on condition of anonymity, âbut it seems like heâs aged a decade or more in just the past few months. Everyone is very concerned about him and even his physician has told him to cut back on his daily tasks. Maybe he should go to Mar-a-Lago more than once a week, you know?â According to aging experts, this is exactly the kind of effect stress and anger have on the human body. âWell just look at him and you can see that heâs not doing well,â said anti-aging specialist and occasional CNN commentator Dr. Saka Ramanathanana. âObviously this Russian situation and the fact that he hasnât signed one bill from Congress is weighing on him greatly. At this pace, he will not be able to stay in office much longer unless he takes some aggressive self-care actions.â Even foreign leaders have noticed the effects of the Oval Office on Trump. During a recent meeting with Egyptian President, Mr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi commented to the President that âhe should take it easy.â âYes, the road to getting control of your country can take years,â said President Fattah Al Sisi in comments he made when questioned about Trumpâs health in Cairo. âHeâs trying to do too much too fast and it shows. Heâs certainly doing all the right things, like marginalizing the press and threatening minorities and all that kind of stuff, but he needs to better pace himself or he wonât gain the control and power he needs to get his agenda done.â The question of President Trumpâs health came up during the daily press brief, which Secretary Sean Spicer dismissed as another fabrication of the liberal media. âLook, you guys like to make stories up to fill the news cycle,â said Spicer answer a question from ABC Newsâ Ann Compton. âThe President is working hard for the American people, putting them back to work and strengthening our country. Thereâs no âthere, thereâ like always.â Despite these health concerns, the President is not letting up. He has scheduled rallies around the country to discuss how well heâs doing, as well as his first campaign fund-raiser next week for the next 2020 Presidential race, which he assumes will be against Hillary Clinton.",0
414,Trump Cuts NASA After Discovering Moon Not Made Of Cheese,https://www.ncscooper.com/trump-cuts-nasa-after-discovering-moon-not-made-of-cheese/,"Washington D.C. â Trump Advisers today released official notice that space program NASA is losing all federal funding after the president was told by his second chief of staff, John Kelly in a âfrustratingly stupid argument with a simple manâ that the moon was not made of cheese like he was told as a young boy. Kelly was brought on July 31st to the White House to bring order and peace to the chaos of the Russian collusion case, and the day to day bumbling about of the new White House staff. With confusing public relations with the Charlottesville protests and his slowly degrading reputation in D.C. Kelly has been having a difficult time keeping up with the latest fire he has been tasked to put out and has been overheard arguing with the president over certain procedures and sometimes silly things like what the moon is made out of. One employee, who wishes to remain anonymous and is working closely with Kelly told us, âThe president? I mean heâs alright I guess. [Kelly] thinks heâs a simpleton, has to over-explain everything to him, like a kid you know? I could have sworn I heard the two of them goinâ on about how Santa Claus was a fairy tale and not really a guy in a suit that brings you presents every year. Trump eventually put his fingers in his ears and started yelling âfake newsâ over and over again so that he couldnât hear [Kelly] and they both let it go after that.â NASA has been a wonderful, and highly educational factor of American Society since its foundation in 1946. Pushing the boundaries of exploration in the name of science and progress, NASA is currently working on various projects ranging from the Curiosity Mars Rover to the projects the men and women perform on the International Space Station. American Astronauts at the ISS upon learning that they will be coming back home much sooner than expected are going to be missed by their international team, and have this message to give to America, âCitizens of the USA, stand up for your rights now more than ever. The man in charge is not very bright, and while the rest of the world is going to move on he is going to keep you, the United States behind. Donât let one man ruin generations of hard work. Together, we can achieve more.â",0
415,Russian Space Agency Leaks Flat Earth Photograph,https://www.ncscooper.com/russian-space-agency-leak-flat-earth-photograph/,"Moscow, Russia â Late this week, the official Russian news agency TASS accidentally released photograph from Roscosmos which seemed to show that the Earth is flat. The picture was taken during a recent Russian restocking flight for the International Space Station when Cosmonaut Sergei Sokolov was performing a routine spacewalk to examine the fuel storage on the exterior of the vessel. American Astronaut Jim Selves, of Topeka, Kansas photographed the Russian through a portal window. Roscosmos, which is the Russian Space Agency, denied the photograph was real and blamed the American âfake newsâ media for propagating a false narrative âThis another untrue assertion by the American fake media to make the Russian Federation look bad,â said Roscosmos spokeswoman Vetkhany Millbrigt during a press conference early Friday morning. âAlthough we should remain skeptical about the world around us, Iâve spoken with Cosmonaut Sokolov personally and he has no recollection of any spacewalk or a photograph. The photograph was first circulated by CNN, during The Situation Room hosted by Wolf Blitzer, but was soon picked up by other mainstream media outlets. The popular debunking site Snopes.com has yet to discuss the issue. In the modern era, the availability of communications technology and social media like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter have made it easy for individuals, famous and not, to spread disinformation and attract others to their erroneous ideas. One of the topics that have flourished in this environment is that of the Flat-Earth. The solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, gave rise to numerous YouTube videos purporting to show how the details of the eclipse prove the earth is flat. In 2017, âthe Tunisian and Arab scientific and educational worldâ had a scandal when a Ph.D. student submitted a thesis âdeclaring Earth to be flat, unmoving, young (only 13,500 years of age), and the center of the universe.â CNN has denied that it is false information and that the photograph was mentioned last year in the infamous dossier which also mentions then-candidate Donald Trumpâs run-ins with Russian prostitutes, implying that the flat earth photograph and the yet-to-be-seen âpee-peeâ video are somehow linked.",0
416,President Trump Pauses to Honor the Victims of 7/11,https://www.ncscooper.com/president-trump-pauses-to-honor-the-victims-of-711/,"Washington, D.C. â This morning, President Donald Trump and Secondary First Lady Melania Trump took time out of their schedules to honor victims of what the president called âone of the worstest, bigliest sad moments in American history.â Standing in front of a convenience store just a few blocks away from the White House, President Trump laid a wreath of flowers and paper coffee cups in front of the store. He solemnly placed his hand over his heart as he asked Melania to get out her smartphone and play âthe country song.â Mrs. Trump did as she was asked, and the National Anthem began playing from the phone. After it was finished, Trump gave a few remarks. âYou know, when I became president,â Trump began, âeveryone said that honoring those who fell on that fateful day 16 years ago would be the toughest and most rewarding experience in the first year of my administration. And they were not wrong.â Trump said he would ânever forgetâ the day the attacks, which were the reason for the ceremony he was holding, took place. âI was watching TV in my Trump Tower apartment,â Trump told those gathered, âand I remember seeing that we had been attacked. Then, and Iâll never forget this, I saw probably sixteen or seventeen thousand Muslims dancing and cheering in the streets! In America! From my balcony, no less!â At one point, it became clear that Trump may have been a bit confused. âThe one thing I wasnât sure of,â Trump said, âwas whether it was just the one 7/11 that was attacked, or if it was a coordinated attack. It really bothered me, not knowing, so when I was sworn in, the first thing I did was instruct my staff to gather all the intelligence, all the classified and unclassified information we have on the attacks, and bring it to me so that I could study it.â Trump said he was âsurprised and shockedâ to find out that none of the intelligence he saw pointed to a Slurpee conspiracy. And none of the information he was provided gave clues to figuring out if a Big Gulp cabal was used, or if the terrorists who perpetrated the attack bought âany of those weird hot dog things they sell there.â âI know what I know, and I know what I saw,â Trump said, âon that day weâll all never forget. But yet, nothing that I was given had anything to do with 7-11 convenience stores. What the fuck? What is this, some kind of satirical news story just written to justify a joke about how dumb I am in real life, and the satirist ran out of steam halfway through this paragraph and now heâs just literally typing in a stream of consciousness way, just letting whatever dumb shit hits his brain get out there without any filter? Well, in that regard heâd be acting just like me, wouldnât he? So did he just Inception this shit? Whoâs speaking right now? Me, or him? Oh fuck it, Iâm going to go in there and buy sixteen rolled taco meat things and jam in them all in my mouth at once because life is a sad, cold, dark void.â",0

Trump Communication Director Anthony âThe Moochâ Scaramucci was photographed grabbing a quick feel up newly appointed Press Secretaryâs Sarah Huckabee Sanders dress. âI donât even think he was aware he was doing it,â said Associated Press pool photographer Heather Kendall who snapped the unfortunate picture. âI mean, they were huddled on a small couch in the planeâs executive lounge and I said âhold itâ and they all posed. But as soon as I said that, Scaramucci shoved his hand up Secretary Huckabeeâs dress and grabbed her by, well, you know.â Anthony Scaramucci has been criticized for not only mimicking President Trump in his mannerisms but also copying Mr. Trumpâs words verbatim. In fact, the new Communications Director seems to parrot the Presidentâs speeches frequently when being interviewed by the media. However, some say this latest foul is taking âbeing Trumpâ over the line. The picture sent outrage through the liberal blogs and triggered many anti-Trump protests. âWhat the $#@! [redacted] is going on,â said 38-year-old Lucille Easton of Seattle, Washington in a Facebook post. âHow can these people get away with this kind of crap? I mean, theyâre not just talking about it, theyâre doing it right in front of the cameras now. This is totally disgusting and offensive.â When asked about the photograph during the daily press brief, Secretary Huckabee Sanders downplayed what is now being called âGabbing by the Mooch.â âThis is totally been blown out of proportion,â said Ms. Huckabee Sanders taking a question from ABC News. âThe media likes to blow things up like this. Clearly, itâs not what you are saying. Mr. Scaramucci is just a little grabby, like most men. Locker room stuff and there was nothing improper about what he did. He does it all the time. He did the other day to Kellyanne and she loved the attention.â There has been no comment from the President. When asked during a ceremony today honoring Confederate losses during the Civil War, the President said, âCould you be any ruder interrupting this?â",0

This also makes Barron the head of the investigation into his fatherâs alleged links to Russia. âI have total faith in Barronâs abilitiesâ, explained President Trump at the new directorâs official swearing-in ceremony in Washington D.C. âAfter all, heâs got great genes. He will lead an independent investigation. He wonât make any allowances for his daddy, who, by the way, can cut his pocket money by a couple hundred thousand bucks any time a certain someone feels the need to poke his nose in some place.â Barron Trump is the third member of President Trumpâs family to occupy a high-ranking government post, after the Presidentâs daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner. The 11 year old is to be relatively free to carry out his duties independently. According to inside sources, several of his school friends and a Hulk action figure are already tipped for top jobs in the FBI. The FBIâs cryptography department is now due to be converted to specialise exclusively in developing cheats and hacks for difficult computer games. Meanwhile, Barron Trump seems to be taking his new job very seriously. Even before he had been sworn in, the FBI arrested his former maths teacher Karen Saltzman on his instruction. She is being held on charges of murder, cannibalism, weapons trafficking and drug dealing.",0

Iâll be dead in 10 years anywayâ,http://www.the-postillon.com/2017/06/trump-interview-paris-climate.html#more,"Donald Trump has once again managed to snub the international community. The USA pulling out of the Paris climate agreement rends 20 years of tough negotiations useless. Now, in an exclusive interview with The Postillon, he faces the big questions surrounding this historic move in person.Postillon: President Trump, thank you for finding the time for this interview.Trump (lighting a cigar): Yeah, I donât usually like to do interviews. Fake news everywhere! Iâm sure you know that. You seem serious though. Do you mind if I smoke?Postillon: Yes.Trump: Well Iâm smoking anyway. Make America great again!Postillon: [Coughs] Letâs get right to the point: yesterday you shocked the world by announcing that you were pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. What led you to that monumental decision?Trump: Yeah, it was a big decision. Maybe the biggest ever. Almost as big as my election victory in November. They all said it was impossible, Crooked Hillary was gonna win. But then I won the greatest victory in history. The greatest!Postillon: Mm yes. Congratulations once again. But getting back to the climate agreement: why do you want to withdraw your country from the agreement?Trump: Global warming. How long will it take for the US to feel serious effects? These eggheads, what are they called again? Oh yeah, scientists. Anyway, they say that itâll be really bad in 15 or 20 years. Iâm 70 now and in 10 years tops Iâll be dead anyway, embalmed and lying in my gold mausoleum in Washington D. C. Why would I care about the climate?Postillon: And your children? They have to continue to live on this planet after you.Trump: Ah, theyâre rich. Theyâll be fine. Ivanka, for example, is smart, rich and very sexy, too. The dream woman if you ask me. The planet canât possibly get as hot as her.Postillon: Okayâ¦ what did you dislike so much about the Paris agreement? Your predecessor Barack Obama made sure it was kept very vague and didnât contain any real consequences for polluters.Trump: Well, to start with, the agreement was very unfair to the USA. At least, thatâs what Steve Bannon and someone on FOX News told me. Also, why would I care about the climate in Paris? I might have reacted differently if it was the Pittsburgh climate agreement. Aside from that, one of my most important goals is to reverse everything that was put into place by this Obama [spits on the floor in disgust]. And: make America great again!Postillon: Yesâ¦but what consequences will this have exactly? Will the USA continue to try and reduce carbon emissions regardless?Trump: We will do the opposite! We want to at least triple our carbon emissions by 2020, maybe even double them! No President before me has ever achieved that. We will do everything possible to reach this ambitious goal. We will convert our electric chairs to use combustion engines and wind turbines will turn backwards and consume electricity. If necessary, we will build factories which donât even make anything. Theyâll just burn trees and produce smoke. And that even has the side effect of generating jobs.Postillon: Butâ¦that would be pretty harmful to the climate...Trump: Thatâs nonsense. Climate schlimate. I canât understand why everyone is whinging again. We can do what we want with our American air. If other countries want to keep their own air clean, please, go ahead. Iâm not stopping you. Anyway, if the Earth warms up, I wonât have to go to Mar-a-Lago as often, I can just stay in tropical Washington D. C.Postillon: The USA is now on a level with Syria and Nicaragua, the only countries to have spoken out against the agreement. Does that worry you?Trump: Syria made a good choice not to take part. After all, lots of carbon dioxide is released when we bomb it. And what on earth is Nicaragua? Is that something to do with the N-word?Postillon: Nicaragua is a country in Central America.Trump: I know what Nicaragua is! Youâre not very polite. Make America great again!Postillon: What is your response to those people who say that withdrawing from the agreement will not be an advantage to the US economy? Instead the US will be economically left behind by the rest of the world.Trump: Make America great again!Postillon: Thatâs not really an answer to the que...Trump (louder): MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!Postillon: Oh, okay, well, thank you for the interv...Trump (shouting): MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!",0

On a visit to the capital, the President of the United States became enraged that the French had shamelessly copied the tower of the famous Paris Las Vegas Hotel in Nevada, USA. President Trump explained that he is fighting back against other nations simply appropriating symbols of American culture in this way.The President was already taken aback when he learned that the French capital was also called Paris, just like the famous hotel in Las Vegas. âAt that stage, it could still have been a coincidence,â opined Trump. âItâs a pretty popular name. Paris Hiltonâs called Paris, too.âHowever, when he observed the distinctive shape of the tower, the brazen conterfeit could not be mistaken: âI know a cheap copy when I see one!â the US President is reported to have told French President, Emmanuel Macron, in his fury. âThat is practically an exact copy of the Paris Las Vegas tower! And I know a thing or two about hotels and casinos.âAn angered Trump was not about to accept any objections from his host, Emmanuel Macron, either. âHe had the audacity to claim that it was completely the other way around! As if the greatest country in the world would need to copy from anyone else!âIn fact, half the world is in the business of copying American landmarks. âI hear there are several buildings in Egypt that are just poor-quality copies of the famous Luxor Casino in Las Vegas and in China there are even several whole cities that look just like Chinatown in New York.âPresident Trump explained that he would work to ensure that these impudent counterfeiters either demolish their replicas or pay royalties to the USA. Otherwise, he fears the French may also one day build a copy of the Statue of Liberty.",0

The note reads: A token of my appreciation for your tireless fight for justice and a sign of my respect for you. You should eat it before your hearing today; itâll be great fuel. For optimum results, at least 60 min beforehand so you donât feel bloated at a crucial moment. Best wishes, Donald Trump (tehehe) According to Smith, it is uncertain exactly what kind of cake this is. âIt appears to be a chocolate cake but I have no idea what the green sprinkles are made of. Perhaps theyâre pistachio or mint flavour.â Smith continued, explaining that, unfortunately, Mr Comey was unable to eat the cake. He was very pleased to receive such a lovely gift but, âjust as he was about to cut himself a piece, he suddenly spotted three dead flies lying on it so he had to throw it away. Itâs a shame about the chocolate, though.â",0

At times of short supply, 38 diesel generators can provide additional power. Experts believe that the fast growing levels of soot will soon require the White House to be renamed the Gray House. Figures were already available showing that energy consumption at the White House have increased by 200% since Trump took office. According to a statement from the White House, this is because, âthe President doesnât like it too hot or too cold so the central heating and air conditioning system are both permanently running at full capacityâ. According to Spicer, the Trump governmentâs medium term goal is to put in place targeted measures to foster non-renewable energies so that by 2020, all American households are supplied in a similar manner. âNow youâll have to excuse meâ, said Sean Spicer in closing, âI have to go and shovel 73 wheelbarrows of coal for this evening. The President likes to take hot baths.â",0
423,Iraq War Veteran Dies Trying to Protect Buffet Ice Cream Machine from Obese Woman,http://newsmutiny.com/pages/Local/VetsLastStand.htm,"Home just eight weeks after being wounded during his second tour in Iraq, Javier Rodriguez of Macon, Georgia died in a valiant attempt to protect the financial solvency of his new employer from the gluttony of an overweight customer when he inserted himself between the soft serve ice cream machine at a Country House Buffet restaurant and a four hundred pound woman Thursday afternoon.According to official reports, Rodriguez, a non-US citizen who served eighteen months in Iraq before being discharged after sustaining the ill-effects of a concussive blast in January, died almost immediately from trauma he received from Jessica Clark of nearby Glenhaven when he attempted to repel the morbidly obese womanâs seventh trip back to the all-you-can-eat restaurantâs dessert bar.âSoon as he done it I said to myself, âThat boyâs got a screw loose standinâ between a fat lady and her sundae cart like that',â described one eyewitness, âBut even though he looked real scared, he stood his ground and started begging her, saying âPlease lady noâ, and something about having a wife and kid to feed at home as the big fat cow started mooing, going, 'moooo', 'moooo', louder and louder until I realize sheâs saying âmoveâ, but he wouldnât back down. I aint never seen nothin' braver.âAfter an estimated 30 second stand-off, Clark struck Rodriguez over the head with a clubbed fist, then stomped his prone body once before pouring a seventh large bowl of vanilla-chocolate swirl ice cream topped with hot fudge, brownie bits, M&Ms, peanuts and rainbow jimmies which she consumed inside of three minutes, well before the police arrived.Commented Country House Buffet manager Chuck Patterson, âFor Javier it was not only about protecting the business he depended upon to provide for his family. It was something more. There was something about witnessing a very overweight person sweat while consuming fifteen fried fish filets, three pounds of lasagna and a gallon of clam chowder in one sitting that his sense of honor couldnât abide by.âContinued Patterson: âBut I blame myself. I shouldnât have told him what a predicament these people were putting our restaurant in. I should have known heâd try something like this.âIn view of Rodriguezâs immigration status and the fact that he will not qualify for the attendant benefits a possible posthumous conferral of citizenship by the US government would bring if he had died in combat, friends and family are humbly requesting donations for a memorial service be sent to P.O. Box 2360, Macon, Georgia",0

""The bombs were falling like rain, and the bullets were so thick, it was like a constant swarm of bees buzzing over our heads,"" he described.

I had to go.""Occasionally sliding off script to emphasize the extent of the awe he, ""And everyone else,"" shared for his brave actions, Trump recounted how he organized just half a platoon of Marines to repulse over 3,000 enemy troops during the harrowing fight.""Charlie had the high ground, but luckily we had me, and leading a squad of guys around their flank, I put my M-16 on full automatic and mowed down an entire company of VC - KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA!"" the President, swinging an invisible rifle over the audience, imitated the sound of automatic gunfire.""There were bodies everywhere. It was pretty wild, let me tell you,"" he said.Meanwhile, James McLoughan, a veteran who rescued 10 of his fellow soldiers under nearly identical circumstances in a similar battle in Vietnam, stood stoically beside the Commander in Chief during the entirety of the two-hour long ceremony.""President Trump's actions sound very brave,"" McLoughan later remarked. ""Though I doubt he would say that he didn't do anything that lots of other guys would have done if put in the same position.""Later, Trump went on to compare his heroism in combat with his electoral victory last November.""Just like on the battlefields of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the Vietnamese had us outspent and outnumbered, and yet we prevailed,"" he said. ""Against all odds, we won the war in a landslide, and now they don't know what to do. They don't know what to do.""",0

He promised the wall will âkeep out illegal Canadian immigrants,â whose culture âundermines American values.ââTheyâre coming to the U.S. in droves,â a proponent of the wall claimed at a rally. âTheyâre preaching radical ideas, like that the government ought to provide healthcare for its citizens. They also apologize too much. Here in America, weâre much more inconsiderate than that. Itâs madness!ââI really donât know what Trump is on about,â a Canadian citizen interviewed stated. âNobody is trying to leave Canada for the U.S. If anything, we need a wall to keep Americans out.âTrump also promised that the wall would be financed by the Canadian government. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released a statement shortly after that this claim, of course, is false.

Trump has declared that he is âas surprised as anyoneâ that he has not been impeached yet.Not being unfamiliar with firing people himself, Trump admits that considering the massive series of high-profile gaffes and blunders his administration have made in his short time in office, heâs âshockedâ to still be President.âYou know not much surprises me these days, but even I canât believe Iâm still here after everything Iâve done,â an exasperated Trump told NBC News. âI just canât understand why the public arenât calling for my head.

Itâs crazy,â he said, shaking his head. âThe American people have a lot to answer for.ââMaybe I actually will have to shoot someone on fifth avenue like I promised, but even then I highly doubt Iâd be fired,â he mused, adding that only by making guns, pornography and fast-food illegal would he likely be impeached.",0
431,Mike Pence Hospitalized After Becoming Trapped In Elevator With Woman,http://www.burrardstreetjournal.com/mike-pence-elevator-disaster-with-unknown-female/,"WASHINGTON, DCâThe Vice President of the United States of America is said to be in a âcritical conditionâ in the White House Medical Unit tonight after becoming trapped in an elevator with an unknown woman for almost 20 minutes.Doctors at the WHMU say Pence is âlucky to be aliveâ, claiming âanother minuteâ in the 8Ã6 ft. death chamber would have surely ended the Indiana nativeâs life.âTo be exposed to a young female in such a concentrated dose would be enough for any man, let alone one with such an extreme sensitivity to estrogen,â Dr. Mann told the NY Post. âItâs best that he avoid contact with any woman for a few months, aside from his wife of course.âA White House spokesman claimed the V.P. had become momentarily separated from his Secret Service detail, leading to him entering the elevator unescorted. It is believed that Vice President Pence was unaware a solitary female was already present at the time, and as we now know, tragically this woman was neither his wife, daughter or mother.The mysterious woman, currently being interrogated by Secret Service, was believed to have been fully grown, possibly reaching as tall as 5 feet 7 inches, meaning the Vice President stood little chance of suppressing his natural instinct to accept the womanâs undoubted lust for him.âThe fact that he was able to hold out for nearly 20 minutes without grabbing her is a testament to the kind of man, husband and feminist Mike is,â President Trump later told reporters. âGod knows I would have cracked inside 60 seconds.âAccording to CCTV the woman did attempt to dash out of the elevator once the VP entered, as is standard White House protocol for all female staff, but she was too late. The video shows the Vice President remained calm initially, casually ordering the woman to stand in one corner of the elevator and stare at her feet, with him doing the same in the opposite end. However, disaster struck once the elevator jerked to an abrupt stop and technicians informed the pair it could be up to 30 minutes before they would be freed.Pence immediately began gasping for air and desperately trying to loosen his tie as he slowly slid down onto the floor. âI tried to help him,â the young lady screamed as Secret Service dragged her away, but this only made the situation worse as video evidence shows the woman was not wearing a skirt that fully covered her knee, sending the VP into anaphylactic shock.Luckily emergency services were able to blast open the doors of the elevator in time to save the Vice Presidentâs life and in all likelihood save the young lady from the electric chair.Pence is expected to make a full recovery physically, however doctors warn the entire incident could result in some long-term psychological issues for the V.P. surrounding women.",0

However the 45th President maintains he holds his friends in the Kremlin solely responsible:âVlad swore to me that this was his guy, you know, this was THE guy,â Trump dismayed, during his weekly conversation with Sean Hannity. âBut now, instead of hiding all my secret dealings with Russia, Flynnâs getting mixed up in all this shit himself. Itâs terrible.ââI mean how the hell are me and Vlad suppose to hide our top-secret relationship if we have these types of breaches. Itâs totally unacceptable.âTrump professed he was âshocked biglyâ when Flynn first revealed his conversations with Russia, saying he was âhurtâ his advisor hadnât simply gone through him instead.âAt the end of the day, it shows a lack of trust in my ability as a leader, to conduct my shading dealings with Russia myself,â he shrugged. âWhat else could I do?âHowever, always keen to âlearn and growâ from an experience, Trump claims he will thoroughly vet whoever Russia selects as Flynnâs replacement.As for Flynn himself, having now been fired by two Presidents, the 59-year-old simply hopes itâll be âthird time luckyâ when President Pence assumes office in a few weeks.",0

While some conservative gays were absolutely shocked that Trump would do such things, it should have been patently obvious with his administration picks that President Trumpâs idea of âMake America Great Againâ hearkens back to his childhood time of the late 1940s to 1950s, where the word gay meant âhappyâ, Jim Crow was the law of the South and women were all June Cleavers standing attention and ready to serve their Ward Cleavers.The backlash against President Trumpâs decision to remove a sector of the LBGT community from the military service has been predictable.  George Takei is on Facebook making smarmy commentary, disgruntled Congressional members from liberal-voting districts are making enough noise so that their constituents will vote for them again and Republicans saw Trump follow-up his military announcement with a Tweet stating, âWE WORSHIP GOD â in America.âHook, line, sinker.  The art of the deal.  Liberals are sulking and fussing like angry children, conservatives are eating up Trumpâs demagoguery.  The official talking point is that President Trump  needed to save the GOP budget and key votes hinged on the âdrasticâ amount of money having to be spent on those Trump kicked out of service.  The truth of the matter is that the measure being debated was .00003% of the overall military budget, but cuts between 3 â 15,000 service members out of duty effective immediately.Now that President Trump is rolling back rights, it is time to think if there are other minorities who are just burdening the military and beyond.  It is estimated that the army must spend more then $500,000,000,000 per year in programs aimed at diversity recruitment and training.   A dramatic increase of budget would be achieved if the army turned back to only housing Caucasian males.  Women could stay in America growing victory gardens while other minorities could just move back to their neighborhoods, as we know, segregation and separate and not equal schools, housing and roads would save America trillions.If Trump were to push for such things, the only thing heâd have to worry about are snarky retweets and Facebook social warriors ballyhooing him for a few days, but then just accepting the new reality and moving on.

The science is pure and true, this is why the Trump Administration and Congress are rushing to get 22 million people off of that expensive Obamacare by passing the American Health Care Act.And instead of calling the new insurance TrumpCare, it is more appropriate to call it True Cross because that will be the source of all healing the poors will be receiving once the wonderful new health insurance â prayer â is rolled out to them.",0

Days after Trump admitted to randomly killing puppies, his lead in the polls grew by six points. Much like previous incidents that pundits believed would hurt Trump, the puppy killing affair has only bolstered his standing as an outsider and a non-traditional politician. âDonald has my vote all the way,â said fervent supporter Daniel Gunther of Florence, Missouri. âAny of these other politicians, if they killed a puppy, theyâd hide it. Theyâd hire a PR firm and go on TV and cry about it like a big baby. Hell, Iâll bet Hillary is killing some puppies right now as we speak. But we wonât hear about it because of the liberal media and because she has a staff of hundreds of people who spend all day just covering up for her.â âThe puppy killing, that was a hell of a move,â said political analyst Paul Begala. âPoliticians have been scared away from the whole dog abuse thing since Lyndon Johnson held up that beagle by its ears. Donald Trump just let the whole world know that heâs not afraid to go where others refuse, and many voters find that to be a refreshing change. Luckily for Donald, Charles Manson is not running for President. Charlesâ penchant for not being afraid to speak his mind might resonate with the voters even stronger than Donaldâs.â Though it resulted in a spike in his poll numbers, Donald Trump insists that the puppy killing was not a politically motivated stunt. âLook, those puppies had it coming,â said Trump. âThey were losers. Donât get me wrong, there are some good dogs out there, but these were losers. Just crawling around, chewing on toys, peeing and pooping. Not the types of puppies we need to make America great again. So, I fired them. By which I mean, I killed them. And I did a tremendous job.â Other GOP candidates, perhaps fearing reprisal, have largely ignored Trumpâs puppy killing. New Jersey governor Chris Christie, however, did step into the fray. âThe killing of puppies by Donald Trump was a disgrace, ok?â said Christie. âWhat was the point? I urge my fellow Americans to put their trust in me as a great leader and as a superior puppy killer. I, for one, would have made sure that those puppies were eaten after they were killed. Even if I had to do it myself. Right there after I killed them. Theyâre really not bad raw.â For his part, candidate Jeb Bush attempted to cash in on the momentum Trump gained after the incident. âI am one hundred percent against all of this political correctness we have today,â said Bush while glumly poking a labrador retriever with stick. âI have never been afraid of doing what I think is best, including poking this dog with a stick.â However, the labrador quickly grew bored with Jebâs poking and wandered off, along with the assembled crowd and media.",0
440,Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump employ cupping for extra boost in campaigns,http://www.derfmagazine.com/news/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-olypic-cupping,"WILMINGTON, NC - Following a campaign rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump turned his back to the crowd and many noticed the large red circles on the back of his neck near his collar. At another rally in Tampa, Florida, supporters of Hillary Clinton noticed similar discolorations. After questions were raised with both campaigns, it has been revealed that both candidates are employing the cupping technique used by Olympic athletes in hopes of boosting their campaigns. The Clinton campaign has been secretive about exactly how much cupping is going on. âSecretary Clinton is entitled to privacy in this matter,â said spokesman Harold Blackmon. âThe exact locations and number of suctions have been accounted for, though several may have been deleted through no fault of Mrs. Clinton or her campaign, or her private cupping server. Any further questions can be addressed to Mrs. Clinton when she holds a news conference. Which, will be never.â Hillary Clinton first became aware of cupping several years before the Rio Olympics. âShe actually learned about it from her husband,â said former advisor Paul Begala. âHe came home one night with red blotches on various parts of his body and he explained to her the benefits of cupping. It turned out that the marks on Bill were actually hickies, but the explanation still took root.â âThis cupping thing is turning out to be huge,â said Republican nominee Donald Trump. âItâs even making America win again. In the Olympics. Notice, for the past four years, the USA has not won even one medal in the Olympics. Thanks Obama. But now we are winning again. Thanks to me. And suction cup attachments on the skin. Which are awesome and they look great on me. I am tempted to go shirtless horseback riding with Vladimir Putin to show everyone how great the red circles look on my beautiful orange skin.â When asked how and where he gets the suction cups applied, Trump responded, âThereâs a very smart, coherent young man who hangs outside Trump tower. Smart kid. Well spoken kid. Good supporter. He has suction cups. He says heâs gonna use them to climb my building, but for now heâs happy to use them to cup my body.â",0
441,Hillary Clinton used personal e-mail account to access State Department Candy Crush account,http://www.derfmagazine.com/news/politics/hillary-clinton-email-candy-crush,"WASHINGTON, DC - An investigation into State Department emails has found problems with former Secretary of State Hillary Clintonâs improper use of personal email for government business. The investigation has further discovered that Clinton used her personal email to access and take over the State Departmentâs Candy Crush gaming account. âEvery avenue is being explored,â said investigator Walter Sokolowski. âIn these dangerous times, it is important for government officials to be held to a higher standard, especially when it comes to matters of national security. Itâs a domino effect. First comes  personal email being used for a government game app, then comes personal emails being used for launch codes, military secrets, and X-Box 360 accounts. We must stop the bleeding.â Republicans and conservative media outlets have been fiercely critical of Clintonâs use of personal email to access the State Department Candy Crush account. âThis is a breach of the public trust,â said House Speaker John Boehner. âIf Hillary Clinton is allowed to do this with the Candy Crush account, whatâs stopping Vladamir Putin from being allowed to use a personal email account to link into the governments Farmville 2 account, an account that has thrived into a spectacular farm, producing acres of fresh agriculture every hour. It is, in fact, the only evidence of bipartisan success achieved in Washington DC in the last fifteen years.â Though the outrage is mounting, Hillary Clinton is downplaying the matter. âI lost my old account and didnât want to start all over on level one,â she explains. âIâd pushed through some really tough levels and I did it all for the American people. Besides, I made no secret of doing it. My login was HillaryClinton2016 and my password was BillisAJerk6969.â",0

Upping the rhetoric, Democrats have now called for Donald Trumpâs hair to produce a birth certificate for examination. Constitutional scholars are uncertain what impact the hairâs birth certificate would have on a possible presidency. âOur founding fathers were not clear on this subject,â said historian Dennis Kerns. âMany of them had hair of unknown origin, though usually of the powdered wig rather than double comb-over variety.â A representative for Donald Trumpâs hair says that all questions will be answered in due time. âThis is nothing more than a smear campaign,â said Donald Trumpâs hair spokesman Ronald Cole. âMr. Trumpâs hair will not dignify these rumors and false allegations as to its origin by commenting on them in any way.â Mr. Cole was referring to allegations made by a hard core fringe group of Democrats who have come to be known as the âHairbirther movement.â Members of the movement have made many claims as to the origin of Trumpâs hair, including that it is of foreign or extra-terrestrial origin. Others go further and allege that it is the product of a relationship involving bestiality. âIf Donald Trumpâs hair has nothing to hide, then we urge it to produce a birth certificate,â said prominent Hairbirther Michelle Waxman. âWithout actually seeing the paper in front of me, with my own eyes, I am only left to conclude that Donald Trumpâs hair is indeed Belgian, marsupial, and at least slightly radioactive.â",0

Her finger remains firmly on the pulse of the American people,â explained close Clinton confidant Joe Bastia.The political tome is a candid account of how Clinton is unable to be candid, preferring to give a calculated version of her experiences which best give the impression of a person humbled, emboldened and more determined than ever to put the American people second after her own ambitions.The memoir entitled âWhat Happenedâ is a detailed account of a small fraction of things that happened that Clinton and her team want the public to know, according to the bookâs publisher. However, there are endless examples of instances in which Clinton was touched, moved and inspired by the type of ordinary people her team worked so hard not to expose her to.âCome on, what do you think sheâs going to do, cop to being a rich white person and admit to being like 90% of other politicians. Ha, nice one, while sheâs being honest like that sheâll probably tell the public how much they fucked up her chance to be President, the stupid idiots.

In fact, the 43-year-old mother of two has remained steadfast in ignoring the late-night ramblings of the president elect that many have speculated are distracting the public.âExcuse me, but I just have more important things to do,â says Jen. âLike getting my kids off to homeschool, or telling the day laborers outside of Home Depot to get out of my country.âDemonstrating her ability to focus solely on advocating for white supremacy, Mitchell admitted she was unaware Trump tweeted that flag burners deserve to lose their citizenship.âOh, I donât let myself get wrapped up in that Twitter stuff,â Mitchell says. âIâm just excited that we finally have a president who puts real Americans first.âWhile many have worried that Trumpâs tweets are a distraction from his controversial cabinet appointments, conflicts of interest, and unprecedented refusal of media access, Mitchell has proven the naysayers wrong by refusing to take the bait.âI didnât vote for Trump because of what he tweets,â she explains. âI voted for Trump because I want our jobs back from the Mexicans, I want the hundreds of ISIS members coming into our country every day to be stopped, and because I donât think having white skin is a crime.âMitchell proudly admitted similar ignorance to Trumpâs social media statements on Hamilton, protesters, CNN, and the New York Times.âTwitter is just a distraction,â says Mitchell. âThatâs why I get my news from real sources: Breitbart, TheEagle.Macedonia, my nephewâs memes, and secret Facebook groups whose names I wonât tell you because I donât want you to get the wrong idea about me and my friends.ââWeâre good people,â she adds.While the coastal elites have been fretting about the first amendment and mental instability, Mitchell has never wavered from the prejudice that inspired her to vote for Donald Trump in the first place.

Should I be honest and let him know just how bad things are, or do I let him enjoy his childhood, his innocence a little while longer? How much longer can we pretend the bathroom door lock is âbrokenâ while Donald is stuck in there?Many of us are concerned about how our sons will learn to treat women in this dangerous, sexist climate. In the case of my son, the nationâs biggest tragedy since 9/11 just told him to stop being a pussy.How am I supposed to explain that our next president is a bully, and also his father?And how do I explain to my son that our next president is a man who intimidatingly looked over at my ballot, just to make sure I was still voting for him? Should I remind my son that this man is a terrible role model and his behavior unacceptable, just like Iâve been quietly whispering to him for his entire short life?And when he gets older, how am I supposed to tell them how this all began? That their father admitted to sexual assault, never shared his tax returns, was endorsed by the KKK, and still somehow weaseled his way into the presidency without even winning the popular vote? I used to believe that this country was an equal playing field where anyone can make it with hard work, but now Iâm not so sure. I hate that my son has to come of age in such a time of uncertainty and also have blood relation to the cause of it all.What am I supposed to tell my only son about the loud, nasty man on TV who insults immigrants while hiring thousands of them, including me, his wife? Do I need to tell him anything at all when he is on the TV standing right next to that man?It seems like itâs always on the tip of my tongue these days; that âDonald Trump is a bad man.â But I canât bring myself to tell him. Mostly because a man said heâd âsend me back to Sloveniaâ if I did. But in my heart, I am concerned for the future of our country.

The idea of using enchantment spells to arm the opposition should be considered.âClinton refutes that claim, saying that the email was discussing strategies to help the opposition rebels oust Muammar Gaddafi in Libya and that it never read âenchantment spells,â but actually stated âprivate security experts.ââThe email text you are referencing is a Photoshopped internet meme,â contends Clinton.The juryâs still out amongst voters, however, with many Republicans raising questions as to whether the practice of magic may have conflicted with her duties as Secretary of State.âI donât need more than one email address, but then again, Iâm not a witch,â says former Florida governor, Jeb Bush. âI guess I would create a second or third email address if I was developing and casting a whole bunch of new top secret magical spells.ââThis accusation is insulting,â Clinton said in a statement to the press. âI am not a witch and never have been, because witches, as they are traditionally represented in popular fiction, do not exist. Would you ask a male presidential candidate if he was a witch?ââYou know what else sounds like a witchâs spell?â says Tucker Carlson on his program this Tuesday. âBenghazi.â",0
457,New Bill Requires Women Seeking Abortions to Paint Still Life of Fetus,http://reductress.com/post/new-bill-requires-women-seeking-abortions-to-paint-still-life-of-fetus/,"In the latest attempt to discourage women from seeking abortions, Republicans have introduced a new bill requiring women to first paint a still life oil portrait of the fetus before consulting with a physician.If the bill passes, abortion seekers will need to obtain pre-approval from a special committee made up entirely of men over 70 years old, each one selected for the quality of their masculine horse art rather than their knowledge of the female reproductive system.âWe just want to make sure these women know exactly what theyâre getting into,â says one sponsor of the bill. âAnd this is one painstaking and difficult way to do that.âThe new bill requires all fetal portraits to be âdetailedâ and âlife-likeâ, although it notes that some impressionism will be tolerated if it appears to express feelings of regret.Though critics have noted current medical guidelines recommend pregnant women avoid exposure to oil-based paints, Rep. Pittenger (R â NC) claims, âWe would never compromise on artistic quality in the name of protecting women.âWomen whose paintings fall short of these exacting aesthetic standards can re-submit a new painting after a one-month waiting period.Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-ME) voted against the bill after failing to pass an amendment that would have added acrylics and watercolors to the list of approved media.Rep. Pittenger states, âI respect Molly, but when it comes to womenâs health we refuse to lower the bar. The rich colors of an oil painting can capture details of the fetus that you just canât see in a sonogram.âUnder the new law, women would be responsible for purchasing all their own oil paints, easels, canvases, brushes, and gesso.A Hobby Lobby spokesperson praised the bill as in-line with the companyâs values, while hospitals and clinics are expected to combat the law, claiming it will be expensive to provide women with adequate studio space.Republicans in congress recommend any woman who believes she may someday need an abortion begin a two to four-year fine arts degree program immediately.Pressed for a closing comment, Rep. Pittenger says, âIâve heard of some women practicing their still-lifes with peaches, but the colors there arenât quite right. So a background in the arts is absolutely vital, but we wonât be paying for that either.â",0

All say it. Because itâs true. But one thing he does do is stand for the pregame national anthem â same as every quarterback who has won the Super Bowl. Sorry, but I think thatâs some pretty good company to be in. Iâll take my chances.âJaguars receiver Allen Robinson said he is happy that Jacksonville is sticking with Bortles.âDo I think weâll make the playoffs with him? No, not at all,â said Robinson. âBut knowing that he is somewhere on the sidelines standing up and not kneeling, will make the next three hours of losing 30-10 feel so much better.â",0

The presidentâs spokesperson also refused to comment on reports that Trump ordered the Indian ban after overhearing part of a report on Fox News about the Cleveland Indians winning an American League record 21 games in a row.âIf the implication is that the president was scrolling through Twitter while taking a bowel movement, and Fox was on in the other room and he just heard a brief snippet about Indians beating Americans and then yelled out to Stephen Miller, while still on the toilet, to ban all Indians from our country,â said Huckabee-Sanders, âwell, thatâs all the time I have for questions today.âCleveland Indians manager Terry Francona said his team plans to continue to keep playing as long a they can.âOur motivation this whole streak is that the world is basically fâked, so we may as well play our best until the whole thing goes to hell,â said Francona. âThis executive order does nothing to change that point of view.â",0

Also, Iâm told I made a Supreme Court judge. I hope the judge is not Steph Curry and is maybe one of the Pittsburgh Penguins. Please tune into Sports Radio 980: The Yakker tomorrow for more.âTrump will be joined on his radio show by new co-host Jay Mariotti, while Mike Pence will takeover as President of the United States.âWhile I want all the players to stand for the anthem, they have a right not to,â said Pence. âHowever, I do think they should be fired if they kneel down in a gay way.âSports Radio 980âs station manager Mike Thomas says he is excited to have the former president aboard.âWe like strong takes and divisive takes that get people talking,â said Thomas. âThereâs no one better than Donald at doing that.

This week, North Carolina Democrats, under pressure from the NAACP, dropped the presidential names from their annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner, to erase the legacy of slavery and genocide.âThe nickel, quarter, dollar bill and two-dollar bill will no longer circulate among Democrats because George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves,â said DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. âThe DNC has also decided to purge the $20 bill because of what Andrew Jackson did to Native Americans. The $10 note, likewise, is forbidden for party members, because Alexander Hamilton signed the Constitution, which perpetuated slavery.âWassermann Schultz called on all Democrats to pay for goods and services using only the FDR dime, or the dollar coins bearing the images of Susan B. Anthony or Sacagawea.Fifties, fives and pennies are still under a longstanding DNC ban because Ulysses S. Grant and Abe Lincoln were both Republicans.However, the Democrats grant specific exemptions for use of the $100 bill by rap stars and Hollywood entertainment industry figures, because âthe Benjamins have become essential to those culturally-valuable lifestyles.âFor all other Democrats, the C-Note is verboten âbecause Ben Franklin was a shameless capitalist whose rags-to-riches story gives a false impression to children about the power of free markets, and the value of hard work,â she said.",0

We saw that the people behind Hobby Lobby were all too eager to jump out of their lane (craft supplies) when the moment arose, and now and it is becoming clear that they learned by watching the founder of Home Depot, who just canât stay out of the political arena (made in part, presumably, withPremium Birrill Fir Studs).Bernie Marcus wrote a piece for Real Clear Politics to announce that he is supporting Donald Trump. Granted, he is a home improvement store founder, so no one really asked him, but he did it, we have it, and we are moving forward with the new information now. If someone were to ask me, Iâd say heâs just doing the same thing people speculated Ben Carson and Chris Christie might have been doingwhen they came out in favor of Trump. In the same way there were rumors that Carson and Christie were simply gunning for a chance at being vice president or getting into Trumpâs cabinet, I think Marcus just wants to make sure that if Trump gets the presidency, Home Depot becomes the Official Sponsor of the Mexico-America Wall.Anyway, asking yourself what Marcusâ reasoning is? Here are a few snippets.A plug for the American Dream/Home Depot came first:But I draw even more from lessons learned when we founded The Home Depot in 1978 rather than from the contentious GOP primary of 2016. I genuinely believe that if we to started The Home Depot today, we would fail because of the hurdles government, especially the current administration, places in front of small business owners.  I never forget The Home Depotâs small business roots â we started as a small business with four stores in Atlanta, Georgia.Next came a just-because sort of attack on media and academia:Politicians like Obama and Clinton, aided by the media and academia, have peddled a dangerous sentiment that government can provide for Americans better than the private sector.That shade on media and academia came amidst glorification of the job creation inherent in the founding of small businesses. Note that Marcus took time to praise his employees who have been able to get wealthy without college degrees, but in one quick statement, took a swipe at everyone who works at a university, lab, library, newspaper, television station, etc. So, are jobs really the main focus here at all?He concluded by targeting the #NeverTrump Republicans:As a GOP donor who stood steadfastly behind Jeb Bushâ and who has contributed to candidates for a generation â I urge all Republicans to stand up and be counted in support for Donald Trump.In time, we will surely learn the political inclinations of every founder, mogul, and, in Marcusâ words, âyoung [man willing] to shag carts from a parking lot because he has faith that he and his family can be great.â Marcus is just one of the first of many this election season.In conclusion, make repainting your living room for the ninth time because youâre so bored and lonely that it physically hurts and maybe a sea-foam green accent wall will fill the void your ex-girlfriend left great again or something.",0
470,Assange Truth Bomb: Hillary Clinton And ISIS Are Funded By The Same Money,http://cityworldnews.com/assange-truth-bomb-hillary-clinton-and-isis-are-funded-by-the-same-money/,"In the second excerpt from the John Pilger Special, to be exclusively broadcast by RT on Saturday, courtesy of Dartmouth Films, Julian Assange accuses Hillary Clinton of misleading Americans about the true scope of Islamic Stateâs support from Washingtonâs Middle East allies.In a 2014 email made public by Assangeâs WikiLeaks last month, Hillary Clinton, who had served as secretary of state until the year before, urges John Podesta, then an advisor to Barack Obama, to âbring pressureâ on Qatar and Saudi Arabia,âwhich are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [Islamic State, IS, ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups.ââI think this is the most significant email in the whole collection,â Assange, whose whistleblowing site released three tranches of Clinton-related emails over the past year, told Pilger in an exclusive interview, courtesy of Dartmouth Films.âAll serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some ârogueâ princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.âAssange and Pilger, who sat down for their 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where the whistleblower has been a refugee since 2012, then talk about the conflict of interest between Clintonâs official post, which held throughout Obamaâs first term, her husbandâs nonprofit, and the Middle East officials, whose stated desire to fight terrorism may not have been sincere.John Pilger: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the first two, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation, while Hillary Clinton is secretary of state, and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly Saudi Arabia.Julian Assange: Under Hillary Clinton â and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it â the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. During her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value.JP: Of course, the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group, called ISIL or ISIS, is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation?JA: Yes.Pilger also questioned Assange over increasingly frequent accusations from the Clinton camp, and Western media, that WikiLeaks is looking to swing next weekâs US presidential election in favor of Donald Trump â perhaps at Russiaâs behest.But Assange dismissed the prospect of Trump, who is behind in the polls, winning as unlikely â and not necessarily due to his standing with the electorate.âMy analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment,â said Assange. âBanks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves.â",0

474,Breaking: Conservative Firecracker Tomi Lahren Just Beat The Crap Out Of Sniveling Miley Cyrus,http://thelastlineofdefense.org/tomi-beat-up-miley/,"Tomi Lahren is well known to be a bit short-tempered sometimes, making sure everyone knows that her petite size and adorable appearance doesnât mean sheâs some kind of a pushover. As with most strong conservative women, not only does she shoot with deadly accuracy, she also makes a mean sandwich.Liberals, for some reason, think sandwich making makes a woman less of a person, yet men can make all the sandwiches they want. One of their heroes decided that calling the lovely Ms. Lahren âsandwich makerâ was a good idea, and she paid for it dearly.The liberal was Hillary Clinton supporter and millennial weirdo Miley Cyrus. She ran into Lahren at a Panera Bread shop in Hollywood and made the wisecrack that Lahren should go home to her âmasterâ and make him a sandwich. Lahren wasnât amused. According to counterperson Marianne LaRue, Lahren lost it almost immediately, screaming as she ran at Cyrus and thoroughly enjoying beating her senseless when she reached her:âShe was like aâ¦a spider monkey. Little Tomi Lahren grabbed that Hannah Montana girl by the neck and twisted her up like a pretzel. She was terrified of that little blonde maniac. It took four people to get the little thing off of her.âEventually police had to be called to stop the beating and Lahren was taken into custody for assault. Cyrus, who was ushered away a blubbering mess, later dropped the charges, probably to keep the story of her humiliation from getting out.",0

While some believed he was filing a building application to have the site demolished and replaced with a Trump Hotel, insiders believe it was actually documents from Inland Revenue proving he had paid no tax. Mr Trump placed the folded up pieces of paper into a crack in the wall, before saying a short prayer to himself.

Trump has been struggling to defend his comments â widely deemed preposterous, even by St. Landry Parish educational standards â in which he claimed a man who owned as many as 300 slaves wouldâve found a way to prevent the Civil War. âPeople donât realize, you know, the Civil War, if you think about it, why?â he told his interviewer, Salena Zito, a host on SiriusXMâs P.O.T.U.S. channel, who spoke to Mr. Trump for an article that was published on Sunday in The Washington Examiner. Mr. Trump followed up on the comment in a tweet on Monday night, arguing that Jackson saw the Civil War coming and would have prevented it had he not died 16 years earlier. The Donald, a member of the Party of Lincoln, elaborated on his recent controversial remarks about how the first Democratic U.S. president, who died 16 years before the Civil War, would have managed to avoid a war the first Republican president could not.Trump, a noted fan of Kentucky Fried Chicken, explained how Col. Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter. Speaking to our intern Dave Robicheaux, who is paid in Facebook likes, Trump insisted Col. Harland Sanders, whom he called a âtremendous Civil War hero,â once saved an entire army at Valley Forge from certain starvation. Trump, a noted fan of Kentucky Fried Chicken, explained how Col. Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter. Robicheaux attempted to explain to Trump that Col. Sanders was born 25 years after the end of the war, that The Donald seemed to be confusing the food incident with a Biblical story about Jesus feeding the multitudes, and that Valley Forge was neither an encampment nor a battle site during the Civil War. Upon being confronted with these facts, The Donald abruptly ended his interview with us, and he was last seen headed for a Confederate monument removal protest in New Orleans while screaming about fake news. Churchâs Chicken and Popeyeâs Louisiana Kitchen were unavailable for comment. Incidentally, Trump has promised to deport every worker at those two companiesâ restaurants if they donât share their respective secret recipes with him.",0

It follows similar strategies in the steak, water and university industries. Analysts say businesses are seven times more likely to go bankrupt once Trump puts his name to them, and have applauded the Presidentâs gesture of lending his name to help stamp out the illicit trade. âHe has a habit of taking flourishing businesses, putting his name on the packaging, and then watching them fail. Thatâs exactly what weâd like to see with drugs,â a DEA spokesperson said. Mr Trump has also been asked to launch a pharmaceutical brand, to help end the countryâs battle with prescription opioids.",0

I just saw my visionary infrastructure plan that would create jobs for millions of Americans like a week agoâmaybe itâs in the car? Couldnât hurt to look there at this point.â At press time, Kushner was still unable to locate his notes for dissuading his father-in-law from taking such a soft stance toward neo-Nazism but ultimately decided he wasnât too excited about that project anyway.",0

The new $20 note, which will feature a portrait of the Brodess family on the front and a depiction of the Maryland plantation they operated on the back, will at last give them their proper place in American history.â Mnuchin then sought to assuage any concerns about the decision, assuring those in attendance that the Trump White House was already looking into ways to preserve Andrew Jacksonâs likeness by having it replace Abraham Lincoln on the $5 bill.",0

The study determined that the 241-year-old federal republic, whose entire government may soon cease to function on account of the head of stateâs desire for a big, tall, and thick wall stretching all the way from one side of the water to the other side of the water, remains widely viewed as an exemplary nation and the preeminent achievement in democratic governance. The report also revealed that the country continues to be regarded as a paragon of excellence and a refuge for all humanity despite its commander-in-chief risking the loss of billions of dollars in potential revenue and the termination of vital public services because he really, really wants the big concrete wall and wants it now. Researchers confirmed that this nation, which may grind to a halt due to the leaderâs demand for a big, giant, cement wall, is absolutely convinced that every other nation should be just like it.",0

483,TACO BAN: PRESIDENT TRUMP PUSHING FOR THE BAN OF MEXICAN FOOD IN THE U.S.,https://www.huzlers.com/taco-ban-president-trump-pushing-for-the-ban-of-mexican-food-in-the-u-s/,"WASHINGTON DC â Months after Trumpâs âMuslim banâ, prohibiting the travel from a list of middle eastern and African countries that pose a threat to the U.S, It is being reported that Trump is also pushing towards a âTaco banâ.Trumpâs hatred for illegal immigrants is no secret, specifically Mexicans. Promising to soon have a wall built on the US/Mexico border to keep illegals out. But nobody ever thought Trumpâs hatred for Mexicans to ever reach these heights. However, a âTaco banâ wouldnât be an accurate term for the proposed ban, as Trump is pushing to have most mexican dishes and products to be banned from America, which includes: tacos, tortas, tostadas, quesadillas, horchata, etc. However, according to Trumpâs team, tequila is still being intensely debated.Although later admitting that he is somewhat a fan of the elote man, Trump told the press: âWe have to get rid of all the Mexican food. If we want to make America great again, we have to earn the respect we once had. Mexico takes us as a joke because they know we[Americans] love Mexican food, and think we canât live without Mexican culture, but itâs my job as the president to show them we can, we have to make America great again. We want nothing to do with Mexico. If all the Mexican food is gone, Mexicans will start leaving as wellâ.Although many Trump supporters are most likely slowly becoming aware that their president is indeed suffering from some sort of yet to be diagnosed mental disorder, experts believe they will still continue to agree and follow with any of his actions. After recently failing to repeal and replace Obamacare, experts believe Trump felt he had to ban something to feel he was in control again, thus leading to the Taco Ban proposal.According to Trump, he will issue an executive order for the âTaco banâ in April, as he also did with the Muslim Ban. Stay tuned for updates on the âtaco banâ and President Trump.",0
